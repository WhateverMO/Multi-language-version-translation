            '汪淼觉得，来找他的这四个人是一个奇怪的组合：两名警察和两名军人，如果那两个军人是武警还算正常，但这是两名陆军军官。    汪淼第一眼就对来找他的警察没有好感。其实那名穿警服的年轻人还行，举止很有礼貌，但那位便衣就让人讨厌了。这人长得五大三粗，一脸横肉，穿着件脏兮兮的皮夹克，浑身烟味，说话粗声大嗓，是最令汪淼反感的那类人。    “汪淼？”那人问，直呼其名令汪淼很不舒服，况且那人同时还在点烟，头都不抬一下。不等汪淼回答，他就向旁边那位年轻人示意了一下，后者向汪淼出示了警官证，他点完烟后就直接向屋里闯。    “请不要在我家里抽烟。”汪淼拦住了他。    “哦，对不起，汪教授。这是我们史强队长。”年轻警官微笑着说，同时对姓史的使了个眼色。    “成，那就在楼道里说吧。”史强说着，深深地吸了一大口，手中的烟几乎燃下去一半，之后竟不见吐出烟来。“你问。”他又向年轻警官偏了一下头。    “汪教授，我们是想了解一下，最近你与‘科学边界’学会的成员有过接触，是吧？”    “‘科学边界’是一个在国际学术界很有影响的学术组织，成员都是著名学者。这样一个合法的学术组织，我怎么就不能接触了呢？”    “你看看你这个人！”史强大声说，“我们说它不合法了吗？我们说不让你接触了吗？”他说着，刚才吸进肚子里的烟都喷到汪淼脸上。    “那好，这属于个人隐私，我没必要回答你们的问题。”    “还啥都成隐私了，像你这样一个著名学者，总该对公共安全负责吧。”史强把手中的烟头扔掉，又从压扁了的烟盒里抽出一根。    “我有权不回答，你们请便吧。”汪淼说着要转身回屋。    “等等！”史强厉声说，同时朝旁边的年轻警官挥了一下手，“给他地址和电话，下午去走一趟。”    “你要干什么！”汪淼愤怒地质问，这争吵引得邻居们也探出头来，想看看出了什么事。    “史队！你说你——”年轻警官生气地将史强拉到一边，显然他的粗俗不止是让汪淼一人不适应。1    “汪教授，请别误会。”一名少校军官急忙上前，“下午有一个重要会议，要请几位学者和专家参加，首长让我们来邀请您。”    “我下午很忙。”    “这我们清楚，首长已经向超导中心领导打了招呼。这次会议上不能没有您，实在不行，我们只有把会议延期等您了。”    史强和他的同事没再说话，转身下楼了，两位军官看着他们走远，似乎都长出了一口气。    “这人怎么这样儿。”少校小声对同事说。    “他劣迹斑斑，前几年在一次劫持人质事件中，他不顾人质的死活擅自行动，结果导致一家三口惨死在罪犯手中；据说他还和黑社会打得火热，用一帮黑道势力去收拾另一帮；去年又搞刑讯逼供，使一名嫌疑人致残，因此被停职了……”    “这种人怎么能进作战中心？”    “首长点名要他，应该有什么过人之处吧。不过，对他限制挺严，除了公安方面的事务，几乎什么都不让他知道。”1    作战中心？那是什么？汪淼不解地看着面前的两位军官。    接汪淼的汽车驶进了城市近郊的一座大院，从那只有门牌号码没有单位名牌的大门，汪淼知道这里是军方而不是警方的地盘。    会议是在一个大厅里举行的，汪淼一进去就对这里的纷乱吃惊不小。大厅周围是一圈胡乱安放的电脑设备，有的桌子上放不下就直接搁地板上，电线和网线纠缠着散在地上；一大摞网络交换机没有安在机架内，而是随手堆放在服务器上；有好几个投影仪的大屏幕，在大厅的角落里呈不同角度随意立着，像吉普赛人的帐篷；烟雾像晨雾般在半空浮了一层……汪淼不知道这是否就是那名军官所说的作战中心，有一点他可以肯定：这里在处理的事情，已经让人们顾不上其他了。    临时拼凑的会议桌上也是堆满了文件和杂物，与会者大多神情疲惫，衣服皱巴巴的，有领带的都扯开了，好像熬了一夜。主持会议的是一位叫常伟思的陆军少将，与会者有一半是军人。经过简单的介绍，他知道还有少部分警方人员，其他的人都是和他一样参加会议的专家学者，其中有几位还是很有名望的科学家，而且是研究基础科学的。    令他感到意外的是还有四个外国人，这些人的身份令他大吃一惊：其中的两个人也是军人，分别是美军空军上校和英国陆军上校，职务是北约联络员；另外两人居然是美国中央情报局的官员，在这里的职务是什么观察员。1    从所有人的脸上，汪淼都读出了一句话：我们已经尽力了，快他妈的结束吧！    汪淼看到了史强，他倒是一反昨天的粗鲁，向汪淼打招呼，但那一脸傻笑让汪淼愉快不起来。他不想挨史强坐，但也只有那一个空位，他只好坐过去，屋里本来已经很浓的烟味更加重了。1    发文件时，史强凑近汪淼说：“汪教授，你好像是在研究什么……新材料？”    “纳米材料。”汪淼简单地回答。    “我听说过，那玩意儿强度很高，不会被用于犯罪吧？”从史强那带有一半调侃的表情上，汪淼看不出他是不是开玩笑。    “什么意思？”    “呵，听说那玩意儿一根头发丝粗就能吊起一辆大卡车，犯罪分子要是偷点儿去做把刀，那一刀就能把一辆汽车砍成两截吧。”    “哼，根本不用做成刀，用那种材料做一根只有头发丝百分之一粗细的线，拦在路上，就能把过往的汽车像切奶酪那样切成两半……啥不能用于犯罪？刮鱼鳞的刀都能！”2    史强把面前的文件从袋中抽出一半又塞了回去，显然没了兴趣。“说得对，鱼都能犯罪呢！我办过一个杀人案，一个娘们儿把她丈夫的那玩意儿割下来了。知道用的是什么？冰箱里冷冻的罗非鱼！鱼冻硬后，背上的那排刺就跟一把快刀似的……”1    “我没兴趣，怎么，让我来开会就是为这事儿？”    “鱼？纳米材料？不、不，与那些都没关系。”史强把嘴凑到汪淼耳边，“别给这帮家伙好脸，他们歧视咱们，只想从咱们这里掏情报，但什么都不告诉咱们。像我，在这儿混了一个多月，还和你一样什么都不知道。”    “同志们，会议开始。”常伟思将军说，“在全球各战区，我们这里现在成为焦点。首先把当前情况向与会的同志们介绍一下。”    “战区”这个不寻常的术语令汪淼迷惑，他还注意到，首长好像并没有打算向他这样的新人介绍来龙去脉，这倒是印证了史强的话。在常将军这简短的开场白中，他两次提到了“同志们”，汪淼看看对面的两名北约军人和两个美国中情局官员，感觉将军似乎漏掉了“先生们”。    “他们也是同志，反正这边的人都是这么称呼的。”史强低声地对汪淼说，同时用手中的烟指了指那四个外国人。    在迷惑的同时，汪淼对史强的观察力留下了些印象。    “大史，你把烟熄了，这儿的烟味够浓了。”常伟思说，低头翻着文件。    史强拿着刚点着的烟四下看看，没找到烟灰缸，就“吱啦”一声扔到茶杯里了。他抓住这个机会举手要求发言，没等常伟思表态就大声说道：“首长，我提个要求，以前提过的——信息对等！”    常伟思将军抬起头，“没有任何一个军事行动是信息对等的，这点也请到会的专家学者们谅解，我们不可能给你们介绍更多的背景资料。”    “但我们不一样。”史强说，“警方从作战中心成立之初就一直参与，可直到现在，我们连这个机构到底是干什么的都不知道。而且，你们正在把警方排挤出去，你们一步步熟悉我们的工作，然后把我们一个个赶走。”    与会的另外几名警官都在低声制止史强。史强敢对常伟思这样级别的首长这么说话，汪淼有些吃惊，而后者的反击更犀利。    “我说大史，现在看来，你在部队上的老毛病还没改。你能代表警方吗？你因为自己的恶劣行为已被停职好几个月了，马上就要被清除出公安队伍。我调你来，是看重你在城市警务方面的经验，你要珍惜这次机会。”    大史用粗嗓门说：“那我是戴罪立功了？你们不是说那都是些歪门邪道的经验吗？”    “但有用。”常伟思对史强点点头，“有用就行，现在顾不上那么多了，这是战争时期。”    “什么都顾不了了，”一位中情局的情报官员用标准的普通话说，“我们不能再用常规思维。”    那位英军上校显然也能听懂中文，他点点头，“To be or not to be……”2    “他说什么？”史强问汪淼。    “没什么。”汪淼机械地回答。这些人似乎在梦呓，战争时期？战争在哪儿？他扭头望向大厅的落地窗，透过窗子可以看到远处大院外面的城市：春天的阳光下，街道上车流如织；草坪上有人在遛狗，还有几个孩子在玩耍……    里面和外面的世界，哪个更真实？    常将军讲道：“最近，敌人的攻击明显加强了，目标仍是科学界高层，请你们先看一下文件中的那份名单。”    汪淼抽出文件中最上面的那张纸，是用大号字打印的，名单显然拟得很仓促，中文和英文姓名都有。    “汪教授，看到这份名单，您有什么印象？”常伟思看着汪淼问。    “我知道其中的三人，都是物理学最前沿的著名学者。”汪淼答道，有些心不在焉，他的目光锁定在最后一个名字上，在他的潜意识中，那两个字的色彩与上面几行字是不同的。怎么会在这里看到她的名字？她怎么了？    “认识？”大史用一根被烟熏黄的粗指头指着文件上的那个名字问。见汪淼没有反应，他迅速作出反应，道：“呵，不太认识。想认识？”    现在，汪淼知道常伟思把他以前的这个战士调来是有道理的，这个外表粗俗的家伙，眼睛跟刀子一样。他也许不是个好警察，但确实是个狠角色。    那是一年前，汪淼是“中华二号”高能加速器项目纳米构件部分的负责人。那天下午在良湘的工地上，一次短暂的休息中，他突然被眼前的一幅构图吸引了。作为一名风景摄影爱好者，现实的场景经常在他眼中形成一幅幅艺术构图。构图的主体就是他们正在安装的超导线圈，那线圈有三层楼高，安装到一半，看上去是一个由巨大的金属块和乱麻般的超低温制冷剂管道组成的怪物，仿佛一堆大工业时代的垃圾，显示出一种非人性的技术的冷酷和钢铁的野蛮。就在这金属巨怪前面，出现了一个年轻女性纤细的身影。这构图的光线分布也很绝：金属巨怪淹没在临时施工顶棚的阴影里，更透出那冷峻、粗糙的质感；而一束夕阳金色的光，透过顶棚的孔洞正好投在那个身影上，柔和的暖光照着她那柔顺的头发，照着工作服领口上白皙的脖颈，看上去就像一场狂暴的雷雨后，巨大的金属废墟上开出了一朵娇柔的花……3    “看什么看，干活儿！”    汪淼吓了一跳，然后发现纳米研究中心主任说的不是他，而是一名年轻工程师，后者也和自己一样呆呆地望着那个身影。汪淼从艺术中回到现实，发现那位女性不是一般的工作人员，因为总工程师陪同着她，在向她介绍着什么，一副很尊敬的样子。    “她是谁？”汪淼问主任。    “你应该知道她的，”主任说，用手划了一大圈，“这个投资二百亿的加速器建成后，第一次运行的可能就是验证她提出的一个超弦模型。要说在论资排辈的理论研究圈子，本来轮不到她的，可那些老家伙不敢先来，怕丢人，就让她捡了个便宜。”    “什么？杨冬是……女的？！”    “是的，我们也是在前天见到她时才知道。”主任说。    那名工程师问：“她这人是不是有什么心理障碍，要不怎么会从来不上媒体呢？别像是钱钟书似的，到死大家也没能在电视上看上一眼。”    “可我们也不至于不知道钱钟书的性别吧？我觉得她童年一定有什么不寻常的经历，以致得了自闭症。”汪淼说，多少有一些酸葡萄心理。    杨冬和总工程师走过来，在经过时她对他们微笑着点点头，没说一句话，但汪淼记住了她那清澈的眼睛。    当天晚上汪淼坐在书房里，欣赏着挂在墙上的自己最得意的几幅风景摄影，他的目光落在一幅塞外风光上——那是一个荒凉的山谷，雪山从山谷的尽头露出一抹白；山谷的这一端，半截沧桑的枯木占据了几乎三分之一的画面。汪淼在想象中把那个萦绕在他脑海中的身影叠印到画面上，让她位于山谷的深处，看上去很小很小；这时汪淼惊奇地发现，整个画面苏醒过来，仿佛照片中的世界认出了那个身影，仿佛这一切本来就是为她而存在。他又依次在想象中将那个身影叠印到另外几幅作品上，有时还将她那双眼睛作为照片上空旷苍穹的背景，那些画面也都苏醒过来，展现出一种汪淼从未想象过的美。以前，汪淼总觉得自己的摄影作品缺少某种灵魂；现在他知道了，缺的是她。    “名单上的这些物理学家，在不到两个月的时间里，先后自杀。”常伟思说。    晴天霹雳，汪淼的大脑一片空白。后来这空白中渐渐有了图像，那是他那些黑白风景照片，照片中的大地没有了她的身影，天空抹去了她的眼睛，那些世界死了。    “是……什么时候？”汪淼呆呆地问。    “在不到两个月的时间里。”常将军重复道。    “你是指最后一位吧。”坐在汪淼旁边的大史得意地说，然后压低声音，“她是最后一位自杀者，前天晚上，服过量安眠药。她死得很顺溜，没有痛苦。”    刹那间，汪淼居然对大史有了那么一丝感激。    “为什么？”汪淼问，那些照片上死去的风景画仍在他的脑海中幻灯似的循环浮现。    常伟思回答道：“现在能肯定的只有一点：促使他们自杀的原因是相同的。但原因本身在这里很难说清，也可能对我们这些非专业人士根本就说不清。文件中附加了他们遗书的部分内容，各位会后可以仔细看看。”    汪淼翻翻那些遗书的复印件，都是长篇大论。    “丁仪博士，您能否把杨冬的遗书给汪教授看一下？她的最简短，也最有概括性。”    那个一直低着头沉默的人半天才有所反应，掏出一个白色的信封隔着桌子递给汪淼，大史在旁边低声说：“他是杨冬的男友。”汪淼这才想起自己在良湘的高能加速器工地中也见过丁仪，他是理论组的成员，这名物理学家因在对球状闪电[1]的研究中发现宏原子而闻名于世。汪淼从信封中抽出一片散发出清香的东西，形状不规则，不是纸，竟是一片白桦树皮，上面有一行娟秀的字：    一切的一切都导向这样一个结果：物理学从来就没有存在过，将来也不会存在。我知道自己这样做是不负责任的，但别无选择。    连签字都没有，她就走了。    “物理学……不存在？”汪淼茫然四顾。    常将军合上文件夹，“有一些相关的具体信息与世界上三台新的高能加速器建成后取得的实验结果有关，很专业，我们就不在这里讨论了。我们首先要调查的是‘科学边界’学会。联合国教科文组织将2005年定为世界物理年，这个组织就是在这一年国际物理学界频繁的学术会议和交流活动中逐渐诞生的，是一个松散的国际性学术组织。丁博士，您是理论物理专业的，能进一步介绍一下它的情况吗？”    丁仪点点头说：“我与‘科学边界’没有任何直接联系，不过这个组织在学术界很有名。它的宗旨是：自上个世纪下半叶以来，物理学古典理论中的简洁有力渐渐消失了，理论图像变得越来越复杂、模糊和不确定，实验验证也越来越难，这标志着物理学的前沿探索似乎遇到了很大的障碍和困难。‘科学边界’试图开辟一条新的思维途径，简单地说就是试图用科学的方法找出科学的局限性，试图确定科学对自然界的认知在深度和精度上是否存在一条底线——底线之下是科学进入不了的。现代物理学的发展，似乎隐隐约约地触到了这条底线。”    “很好。”常伟思说，“据我们了解，这些自杀的学者大部分与‘科学边界’有过联系，有些还是它的成员。但没有发现诸如邪教精神控制或使用违法药物这类的犯罪行为。也就是说，即使‘科学边界’对那些学者产生过影响，也是通过合法的学术交流途径。汪教授，他们最近与您有联系，我们想了解一些情况。”    大史粗声粗气地开口说：“包括联系人的姓名、见面地点和时间、谈话内容，如果交换过文字资料或电子邮件的话……”    “大史！”常伟思厉声制止了他。    “不吱声没人拿你当哑巴！”旁边一位警官探过身去对大史低声说，后者拿起桌上的茶杯，看到里面的烟头后，“咚”的一声又放下了。    大史又令汪淼像吃了苍蝇一样难受，刚才那一丝感激消失得无影无踪。但他还是克制着回答了这个问题：“我与‘科学边界’的接触是从认识申玉菲开始的，她是一名日籍华裔物理学家，现在为一家日资公司工作，就住在这个城市。她曾在三菱电机的一家实验室从事纳米材料研究，我们是在今年年初的一次技术研讨会上认识的。通过她，又认识了几位物理专业的朋友，都是‘科学边界’的成员，国内国外的都有。和他们的交往时，谈的都是一些很……怎么说呢，很终极的问题，主要就是丁博士刚才提到的科学底线的问题。”    “我一开始对这些问题没有太大的兴趣，只是作为消遣。我是搞应用研究的，在这方面水平不高，主要是听他们讨论和争论。这些人思想都很深刻，观点新颖，自己感觉同他们交流，思想开阔了许多，渐渐变得很投入了。但讨论的话题仅限于此，都是天马行空的纯理论，没有什么特别的。他们曾邀请我加入‘科学边界’，但那样的话，参加这样的研讨会就变成了一项义务，我因为精力有限就谢绝了。”    “汪教授，我们希望您接受邀请，加入‘科学边界’学会，这也是我们今天请您来的主要目的。”常将军说，“我们希望能通过您这个渠道，得到一些这个组织的内部信息。”    “您是说让我去卧底吗？”汪淼不安地问。    “哇哈哈，卧底！”大史大笑一声。    常伟思责备地看了大史一眼，对汪淼说：“只是提供一些情况，我们也没有别的渠道。”    汪淼摇摇头，“对不起，首长。我不能干这事。”    “汪教授，‘科学边界’是一个由国际顶尖学者构成的组织，对它的调查是一件极其复杂和敏感的事，我们真的是如履薄冰。没有知识界的帮助，我们寸步难行，所以才提出了这个唐突的要求，希望您能理解。不过我们也尊重您的意愿，如果不同意，我们也是能够理解的。”    “我……工作很忙，也没有时间。”汪淼推托道。    常伟思点点头，“好的，汪教授，那我们就不再耽误您的时间了，谢谢您能来参加这次会议。”    汪淼愣了几秒钟，才明白他该离开了。    常伟思礼貌地把汪淼送到会议室门口时，大史在后面大声说：“这样挺好，我压根儿就不同意这个方案。已经有这么多书呆子寻了短见，让他去不是‘肉包子打狗’吗？”    汪淼返身回去，走到大史身旁，努力克制着自己的愤怒，“你这么说话实在不像一名合格的警官。”    “我本来就不是。”    “那些学者自杀的原因还没有搞清楚。你不该用这么轻蔑的口气谈论他们，他们用自己的智慧为人类社会做出的贡献，是任何人都不可替代的。”    “你是说他们比我强？”大史在椅子上仰头看着汪淼，“我总不至于听人家忽悠几句就去寻短见。”    “那你是说我会？”    “总得对您的安全负责吧。”大史看着汪淼，又露出他招牌式的傻笑。    “在那种情况下我比你要安全得多，你应该知道，一个人的鉴别能力是和他的知识成正比的。”    “那不见得，像您这样的……”    “大史，你要再多说一句，也从这里出去好了！”常伟思严厉地呵斥道。    “没关系，让他说，”汪淼转向常将军，“我改变主意了，决定按您的意思加入‘科学边界’。”2    “很好，”大史连连点头，“进去后机灵点儿，有些事顺手就能做，比如瞄一眼他们的电脑，记个邮件地址或网址什么的……”    “够了！够了！你误会了，我不是去卧底，只是想证明你的无知和愚蠢！”    “如果您过一阵儿还活着，那自然也就证明了。不过恐怕……嘿嘿。”大史仰着头，傻笑变成了狞笑。    “我当然会一直活下去，但实在不想再见到你这号人了！”    常伟思一直把汪淼送下了楼梯，并安排车送他，在道别时说：“史强就那种脾气，其实他是一名很有经验的刑警和反恐专家。二十多年前，他曾是我连里的一名战士。”    走到车前，常伟思又说：“汪教授，你一定有很多问题要问。”    “刚才您说的那些，与军方有什么关系？”    “战争与军方当然有关系。”    汪淼迷惑地看看周围明媚春光中的一切，“可战争在哪儿？现在全球一处热点都没有，应该是历史上最和平的年代了。”    常伟思露出了高深莫测的笑容：“你很快就会知道一切的，所有人都会知道。汪教授，你的人生中有重大的变故吗？这变故突然完全改变了你的生活，对你来说，世界在一夜之间变得完全不同。”    “没有。”    “那你的生活是一种偶然，世界有这么多变幻莫测的因素，你的人生却没什么变故。”1    汪淼想了半天还是不明白，“大部分人都是这样嘛。”    “那大部分人的人生都是偶然。”    “可……多少代人都是这么平淡地过来的。”    “都是偶然。”    汪淼摇头笑了起来，“得承认今天我的理解力太差了，您这岂不是说……”    “是的，整个人类历史也是偶然，从石器时代到今天都没什么重大变故，真幸运。但既然是幸运，总有结束的一天；现在我告诉你，结束了，做好思想准备吧。”1    汪淼还想问下去，但将军与他握手告别，阻止了他下面的问题。    上车后，司机开口问汪淼家的地址，汪淼告诉他后，随口问道：“哦，接我来的不是你？我看车是一样的。”    “不是我，我是去接丁博士的。”    汪淼心里一动，便向司机打听丁仪的住处，司机告诉了他。当天晚上，他就去找丁仪。')

            '推开丁仪那套崭新的三居室的房门，汪淼闻到了一股酒味，看到丁仪躺在沙发上，电视开着，他的双眼却望着天花板。汪淼四下打量了一下，看到房间还没怎么装修，也没什么家具和陈设，宽大的客厅显得很空，最显眼的是客厅一角摆放的一张台球桌。1    对汪淼的不请自来，丁仪倒没表示反感，他显然也想找人说话。    “这套房子是三个月前买的，”丁仪说，“我买房子干什么？难道她真的会走进家庭？”他带着醉意笑着摇摇头。    “你们……”汪淼想知道杨冬生活中的一切，但又不知该如何问。    “她像一颗星星，总是那么遥远，照到我身上的光也总是冷的。”丁仪走到窗前看着夜空，像在寻找那颗已逝去的星辰。    汪淼也沉默下来。很奇怪，他现在就是想听一听她的声音，一年前那个夕阳西下的时刻，她同他对视的那一瞬间没有说话，他从来没有听到过她的声音。    丁仪一挥手，像要赶走什么，将自己从这哀婉的思绪中解脱出来。“汪教授，你是对的，别跟军方和警方纠缠到一块儿，那是一群自以为是的白痴。那些物理学家的自杀与‘科学边界’没有关系，我对他们解释过，可解释不清。”    “他们好像也做过一些调查。”    “是，而且这种调查还是全球范围的，那他们也应该知道，其中的两人与‘科学边界’没有任何来往，包括——杨冬。”丁仪说出这个名字时显得很吃力。    “丁仪，你知道，我现在也卷进这件事里了。所以，关于使杨冬做出这种选择的原因，我很想知道，我想你一定知道一些。”汪淼笨拙地说道，试图掩盖他真正的心迹。    “如果知道了，你只会卷得更深。现在你只是人和事卷进来了，知道后连精神也会卷进来，那麻烦就大了。”    “我是搞应用研究的，没有你们理论派那么敏感。”    “那好吧，打过台球吗？”丁仪走到了台球桌前。    “上学时随便玩过几下。”    “我和她很喜欢打，因为这让我们想到了加速器中的粒子碰撞。”丁仪说着拿起黑白两个球，将黑球放到洞旁，将白球放到距黑球仅十厘米左右的位置，问汪淼，“能把黑球打进去吗？”    “这么近谁都能。”    “试试。”    汪淼拿球杆，轻击白球，将黑球撞入洞内。    “很好，来，我们把球桌换个位置。”丁仪招呼一脸迷惑的汪淼，两人抬起沉重的球桌，将它搬到客厅靠窗的一角。放稳后，丁仪从球袋内掏出刚才打进去的黑球，将它放到洞边，又拾起那个白球，再次放到距黑球十厘米左右的地方，“这次还能打进去吗？”    “当然。”    “打吧。”    汪淼再次轻而易举地将黑球打入洞内。    “搬。”丁仪挥手示意，两人再次抬起球桌，搬到客厅的第三个角，丁仪又将黑白两个球摆放到同样的位置，“打吧。”    “我说，我们……”    “打吧。”    汪淼无奈地笑笑，第三次将黑球击入洞内。    他们又搬了两次台球桌，一次搬到了客厅靠门的一角，最后一次搬回了原位。丁仪又两次将黑白球摆到洞前的位置，汪淼又两次将黑球击入洞内。这时两人都有些出汗了。    “好了，实验结束，让我们来分析一下结果。”丁仪点上一支烟说，“我们总共进行了五次试验，其中四次在不同的空间位置和不同的时间，两次在同一空间位置但时间不同。您不对结果震惊吗？”他夸张地张开双臂，“五次，撞击试验的结果居然都一样！”    “你到底想表达什么？”汪淼喘着气问。    “你现在对这令人难以置信的结果做出解释，用物理学语言。”    “这……在五次试验中，两个球的质量是没有变化的；所处位置，当然是以球桌面为参照系来说，也没有变化；白球撞击黑球的速度向量也基本没有变化，因而两球之间的动量交换也没有变化，所以五次试验中黑球当然都被击入洞中。”    丁仪拿起撂在地板上的一瓶白兰地，把两个脏兮兮的杯子分别倒满，递给汪淼一杯，后者谢绝了。“应该庆祝一下，我们发现了一个伟大的定律：物理规律在时间和空间上是均匀的。人类历史上的所有物理学理论，从阿基米德原理到弦论，以至人类迄今为止的一切科学发现和思想成果，都是这个伟大定律的副产品，与我们相比，爱因斯坦和霍金才真是搞应用的俗人。”1    “我还是不明白你想表达什么。”    “想象另一种结果：第一次，白球将黑球撞入洞内；第二次，黑球走偏了；第三次，黑球飞上了天花板；第四次，黑球像一只受惊的麻雀在房间里乱飞，最后钻进了您的衣袋；第五次，黑球以接近光速的速度飞出，把台球桌沿撞出一个缺口，击穿了墙壁，然后飞出地球，飞出太阳系，就像阿西莫夫描写的那样[2]。这时您怎么想？”    丁仪盯着汪淼，后者沉默许久才问：“这事真的发生了，是吗？”11    丁仪将手中的两杯酒都仰头灌下去，两眼直勾勾地看着台球桌，仿佛那是个魔鬼，“是的，发生了。近年来，基础理论研究的实验验证条件渐渐成熟，有三个昂贵的‘台球桌’被造了出来，一个在北美，一个在欧洲，还有一个你当然知道，在中国良湘，你们纳米中心从那里赚了不少钱。”    “这些高能加速器将实验中粒子对撞的能量提高了一个数量级，这是人类以前从未达到过的。在新的对撞能级下，同样的粒子，同样的撞击能量，一切试验条件都相同，结果却不一样。不但在不同的加速器上不一样，在同一加速器不同时间的试验中也不一样，物理学家们慌了，把这种相同条件的超高能撞击试验一次次地重复，但每次的结果都不同，也没有规律。”    “这意味着什么呢？”汪淼问，看到丁仪盯着自己不做声，他又补充道，“哦，我搞纳米，也接触物质微观结构，但比起你们来要浅好几个层次，请指教一下。”    “这意味着物理规律在时间和空间上不均匀。”    “这又意味着什么呢？”    “往下您应该能推论出来吧，那个将军都想出来了，他真是个聪明人。”    汪淼看着窗外沉思着，外面城市的灯海一片灿烂，夜空中的星星被淹没得看不见了。    “这就意味着宇宙普适的物理规律不存在，那物理学……也不存在了。”汪淼从窗外收回目光说。    “‘我知道自己这样做是不负责任的，但别无选择。’”丁仪紧接着说，“这是她遗书的后半部分，您无意中刚说出了前半部分，现在多少能够理解她吧。”    汪淼从台球桌上拿起刚才他打过五次的那个白球，抚摸了一会儿轻轻放下，“这对一个前沿理论的探索者确实是个灾难。”    “在理论物理这个领域要想有所建树，需要一种宗教般的执著，这很容易把人引向深渊。”    告辞时，丁仪给了汪淼一个地址。“你如果有空，拜托去看看杨冬的母亲。杨冬一直和她住在一起，女儿是她生活的全部，现在就一个人了，很可怜。”    汪淼说：“丁仪，你知道得显然比我多，就不能再透露一点吗？你真的相信物理规律在时空上不均匀？”    “我什么都不知道……”    丁仪与汪淼对视了好长时间，最后说：“这是个问题。”    汪淼知道，他不过是接下了那位英军上校的话：生存还是死亡，这是个问题。')

            '第二天是周末，汪淼反而起得很早，带上相机骑着自行车出去了。作为一名摄影爱好者，他最向往的题材是人迹罕至的荒野，但人到中年，已经没有精力进行这种奢侈的享受了，大多数时间只能在城市里拍风景了。他有意无意地选取城市中那些散发着蛮荒气息的角落，如公园中干涸的湖底、建筑工地上翻出的新土、钻出水泥缝隙的野草等。为了消除背景上城市的俗艳色彩，他只使用黑白胶片，没想到竟自成一派，渐渐小有名气，作品入选了两次大影展，还加入了摄影家协会。每次出去拍摄，他就这样骑着自行车在城市里随意乱转，捕捉着灵感和他需要的构图，有时一转就是一整天。    今天，汪淼的感觉有些异样。他的摄影以古典风格的沉稳凝重见长，但今天，他很难再找到创造这种构图所需要的稳定感，在他的感觉中，这座正在晨曦中苏醒的城市似乎建立在流沙上，它的稳定是虚幻的。在刚过去的那一夜，那两颗台球一直占据着他长长的梦境，它在黑色的空间中无规则地乱飞，在黑色的背景上黑球看不见，它只有在偶尔遮挡白球时才显示一下自己的存在。3    难道物质的本原真的是无规律吗？难道世界的稳定和秩序，只是宇宙某个角落短暂的动态平衡？只是混乱的湍流中一个短命的旋涡？    不知不觉中，他已骑到了新落成的CCTV大厦脚下。他停下车，坐到路边，仰望这A字形的巍峨建筑，试图找回稳定的感觉，顺着大厦在朝阳中闪烁的尖顶的指向，他向深不见底的蓝色苍穹望去，脑海中突然浮现出两个词：射手、农场主。    在“科学边界”的学者们进行讨论时，常用到一个缩写词：SF，它不是指科幻，而是上面那两个词的缩写。这源自两个假说，都涉及宇宙规律的本质。    “射手”假说：有一名神枪手，在一个靶子上每隔十厘米打一个洞。设想这个靶子的平面上生活着一种二维智能生物，它们中的科学家在对自己的宇宙进行观察后，发现了一个伟大的定律：“宇宙每隔十厘米，必然会有一个洞。”它们把这个神枪手一时兴起的随意行为，看成了自己宇宙中的铁律。    “农场主假说”则有一层令人不安的恐怖色彩：一个农场里有一群火鸡，农场主每天中午十一点来给它们喂食。火鸡中的一名科学家观察这个现象，一直观察了近一年都没有例外，于是它也发现了自己宇宙中的伟大定律：“每天上午十一点，就有食物降临。”它在感恩节早晨向火鸡们公布了这个定律，但这天上午十一点食物没有降临，农场主进来把它们都捉去杀了。14    汪淼感到脚下的路面像流沙般滑动，A字形大厦仿佛摇晃起来，他赶紧收回目光。    仅仅是为了摆脱不安，汪淼强迫自己拍完了一个胶卷，午饭前回到了家。妻子带着孩子出去玩，中午不回来了。往常，汪淼一定会迫不及待地把胶卷冲出来，但今天他一点兴致都没有。简单地吃过午饭后，他倒头便睡，由于昨天夜里没睡好，一觉睡醒后都快五点了。他这时才想起上午拍的胶卷，便钻到那间由壁橱改成的狭窄暗室里去冲洗。    胶片很快冲出来了，他开始查看哪张值得放大洗成照片，在第一张就发现了一件离奇的事。这张拍的是一个大商场外的一小片草地，他看到底片正中有一行白色的东西，细看是一排数字：1200:00:00。    第二张底片上也有数字：1199:49:33。    整卷胶片，每张底片上都有小小的一排数字！    第三张：1199:40:18；第四张：1199:32:07；第五张：1199:28:51；第六张：1199:15:44；第七张：1199:07:38；第八张：1198:53:09……第三十四张：1194:50:49；第三十六张，也是最后一张：1194:16:37。    汪淼立刻想到是胶卷的问题。他使用的是1988年产的莱卡M2型相机，全机械手动，没有任何自动化功能，更不可能往胶片上叠印日期一类的数字。仅凭其品质卓绝的镜头和机械机构，即使在数码时代，也是专业相机中的贵族。3    重新查看每张底片，汪淼很快发现了这些数字的第一个诡异之处：它们自动适应背景。如果背景是黑色，数字则为白色，白色背景上的数字就是黑色，似乎是为了形成最大的反差便于观察者看清。当汪淼再看第十六张底片时，心跳加快了，感到暗室中有一股寒气沿着脊背升上来：    这张拍的是以一面老墙为背景的一棵枯树，老墙斑驳一片，在照片上黑白相间。在这样的背景上，那行数字以正常的位置无论是黑是白都不可能显示清楚，但它竟竖了起来，且弯曲自身，沿着枯树深色的树身呈白色显示，看上去仿佛是附着在枯树上的一条细蛇！    汪淼开始研究那些数字的数学关系，起初他以为是某种编号，但每组数字的间隔并不相同，他很快明白这是以小时、分、秒为单位的计时。他拿出了拍摄笔记，上面详细记录了每张照片的拍摄时间，精确到分。他发现两张照片上计时的差值与它们实际拍摄的时间间隔是一致的。很明显，这卷胶片上反向记录了某个以现实的速度流逝的时间。汪淼马上明白了它是什么。    一个倒计时。    倒计时从1200小时开始，到现在还剩余1194小时。    现在？不，是拍完胶卷最后一张那一时刻。这个倒计时还在继续吗？    汪淼走出暗室，取出一只新的黑白胶卷装到莱卡相机上，在房间里飞快地随意拍摄起来，最后又到阳台上拍了几张室外的画面。胶卷拍完后，他把它从相机里取出来，一头钻进暗室冲洗。冲出来的胶片上，那数字幽灵般地在每一张底片上不断显示出来，第一张是1187:27:39，从上一卷最后一张拍摄到拍这卷的第一张，正好是间隔这么长时间。以后的每一张的计时间隔为三到四秒，1187:27:35、1187:27:31、1187:27:27、1187:27:24……是他快速拍摄的间隔。    倒计时仍在继续。    汪淼再次给相机装上新胶卷，飞快地乱拍起来，有几张他是故意扣上镜头盖拍的。当他将拍完的胶卷取出时，妻子和孩子回来了。在去冲洗前，他给莱卡装上第三个胶卷，把相机递给妻子：“来，拍完这卷。”    “拍什么？”妻子惊诧地看着丈夫。以前，他是绝不允许其他人碰自己的相机，当然她和儿子对那玩意儿也没兴趣，在他们眼里，那是一个两万多元买来的乏味的老古董。    “什么都行，随便拍。”汪淼把相机塞到妻子手中，一头钻进了暗室。    “那，豆豆，我给你拍吧。”妻子把镜头对准了儿子。    汪淼的脑海中突然浮现出幽灵般的数字像一条张开的绞索横在孩子面容前的幻象，他不由微微战栗了一下。“不，别拍儿子，随便拍别的什么吧。”    快门“咔嚓”一声，妻子拍了第一张，然后叫道：“这怎么按不动了？”汪淼教妻子扳了一个手柄，“这样，每次都要倒卷。”然后钻进了暗室。1    “真麻烦。”身为医生的妻子不能理解，在千万级像素的数码相机已经普及的今天，还有人用这种过时的昂贵玩意儿，而且拍的还是黑白胶卷。    胶卷冲出来后，对着晕暗的红灯，汪淼看到那幽灵倒计时仍在继续，在一张张随意拍出的混乱画面上，包括那几张扣着镜头盖拍的，清晰地显示出：1187:19:06、1187:19:03、1187:18:59、1187:18:56……    妻子敲了两下暗室的门，告诉他拍完了。汪淼出门抓过相机，取胶卷时他的手明显地在颤抖。不顾妻子异样的目光，他拿着胶卷又回到暗室，死死地关上门。他干得很忙乱，显影液、定影液洒了一地，胶卷很快冲出来了，他闭上双眼，默默祈祷：别出现，不管是什么，别在现在出现，别轮到我……    他用放大镜沿着湿漉漉的胶卷看去，倒计时消失了，底片上只有妻子拍出的室内画面，在低速光圈下，她那不专业的操作拍出的画面一片模糊，但汪淼觉得这是他看过的最赏心阅悦目的照片了。    汪淼走出暗室，长出一口气，发现汗水已浸湿了全身。妻子去厨房做饭了，儿子也到自己的房间去玩，他一个人坐在沙发上，开始了稍微冷静的思考。    首先，这组在不同的拍摄间隔精确地记录时间流逝，并显示出智能迹象的数字，不可能是预留在胶片上的，只能是某种力量使其感光，那会是什么呢？是相机的问题吗？是某种装置被有意无意地放置到了相机中吗？他将镜头卸下来，把相机拆开，用放大镜仔细地观察着相机内部，检查着每个一尘不染的光洁机件，没有发现任何异常。那么，联想到那几张扣上镜头盖后拍摄的画面，最可能的感光源是外界某种穿透力很强的射线，但这在技术上同样是不可能的：射线源在哪儿？如何瞄准？    至少以现有技术而言，这种力量是超自然的。    为了进一步确定幽灵倒计时已经消失，汪淼又在莱卡相机中装上了一个胶卷，开始一张张地随意拍起来。当这次的胶卷冲出来后，刚刚稍微平静了一会儿的他又被推到了疯狂的边缘：幽灵倒计时又出现了，从画面显示的时间看，它根本就没有停止过，只是在妻子拍的那卷上没有显示而已。    1186:34:13、1186:34:02、1186:33:46、1186:33:35……    汪淼冲出暗室，冲出家门，猛敲邻居的门，开门的是退休的张教授。    “老张，你家有没有相机？哦，不要数码的，要用胶卷的！”    “你这大摄影家朝我借相机？那个两万多的坏了？我只有数码的……你不舒服？脸色这么难看。”    “借我用用。”    老张很快拿来一架很普通的柯达数码相机。“给，里面的几张删掉就行……”    “谢谢！”汪淼抓过相机和胶卷，匆匆返回屋里。其实家里还有三架胶卷相机和一架数码相机，但汪淼觉得从别处借更可靠些。他看着摊放在沙发上的两架相机和几只黑白胶卷，略一思考后，又给莱卡装上了胶卷，然后将数码相机递给正在端饭的妻子：    “快，拍几张，就像刚才一样！”    “这是干什么？看你的脸色……你到底怎么了？！”妻子惊恐地望着他。    “你别管，拍！”    妻子放下手中的碟子，走过来看着丈夫，眼中的惊恐又加上了忧虑。    汪淼把柯达相机塞到过来吃饭的六岁儿子手里，“豆豆，你帮爸爸拍。就按这个，对，这是一张；再按一下，对对，又是一张；就这样一直拍，对着哪儿都行。”    儿子很快掌握了，小家伙很感兴趣，拍得很快。汪淼转身从沙发上拿起自己的莱卡，也拍了起来，父子俩就这样“咔嚓、咔嚓”地疯狂拍着，丢下妻子在频频闪光中不知所措，眼泪涌了出来。    “汪淼，我知道你最近工作压力很大，你可别……”1    汪淼把莱卡相机的胶卷拍完，又从孩子手中抢过数码相机。他想了一下，为了避开妻儿的干扰，走到卧室中，自己用数码相机也拍了几张。他拍的时候用的是目视取景器，没用液晶屏，因为怕看到结果，虽然迟早要看。    汪淼取出莱卡里的胶卷钻进暗室，紧紧地关上门工作起来。冲洗完成后，他细看底片，因手在颤抖，他只能用双手握着放大镜——底片上，幽灵倒计时在继续。    汪淼冲出暗室，开始检查数码相机上的照片，从液晶屏上看到，刚才拍的数码照片中，儿子拍的部分没有显示倒计时；而在自己拍的那部分，倒计时清晰地显示出来，并且与底片上的同步变化。    汪淼使用不同的相机拍摄，目的是排除问题出在相机或底片上的可能性，但他无意中让孩子拍摄，加上之前让妻子拍摄，得出了一个更加诡异的结果：用不同相机和不同胶卷拍摄，别人拍出的都正常，幽灵倒计时只会在他拍摄的照片上出现！    汪淼绝望地抓起那堆胶卷，像抓着一团纠缠在一起的蛇，又像一团难以挣脱的绞索。    他知道，仅凭自己的力量是无法解决这个问题的，那么去找谁呢？大学和研究所里的同事是不行的，他们与自己一样，都是技术型思维的人；直觉告诉他，这件事已超出了技术之外。他想到了丁仪，可现在这人自己也陷入精神危机之中。他最后想到了“科学边界”，那是一群思想深刻而且活跃的人。于是，他拨通了申玉菲的电话。    “申博士，我这里有些事，必须到你那里去一趟。”汪淼急促地说。    “来吧。”申玉菲只说了这两个字就挂断了电话。    汪淼吃了一惊，申玉菲平时说话也十分精简，以至于“科学边界”的一些人戏称她为“女海明威”。但这次，她竟连是什么事都不问，汪淼不知该感到安慰还是更加不安。    他将那团胶卷塞进一个提包，并带上那架数码相机，在妻子焦虑的目光中冲出家门。本来可以开车去的，但即使在这灯火灿烂的城市，他在路上也想有人陪伴，于是叫了出租车。    申玉菲住在新城铁线附近的一个高档别墅区，这里的灯光稀疏了许多，别墅群环绕着几个能垂钓的小人工湖，晚上有一种乡村的感觉。申玉菲显然很富有，但汪淼一直搞不清她的财产来源，她以前的研究职位和现在公司中的职位都挣不到这么多钱。不过她的别墅中并没有豪华享受的痕迹，那里是“科学边界”的一个聚会场所，其中的陈设很像一个带会议室的小图书馆。    在客厅里，汪淼见到申玉菲的丈夫魏成。这个四十岁左右的男人，一副敦厚的知识分子模样，汪淼对他的了解仅限于其姓名，申玉菲介绍时也只说了这些。他似乎没有工作，成天待在家里，对“科学边界”的讨论不感兴趣，对家里频繁来往的学者们也习以为常。    但他并非无所事事，显然在家研究着什么东西，整天沉浸在思考中，见到任何人都是心不在焉地打个招呼，然后回到楼上的房间里，他一天的大部分时间都待在那里。一次，汪淼在楼上无意中从半开的房门向里瞥了一眼，看到一个令人惊奇的东西：一台HP小型机。他不会看错的，因为这台设备与他工作的超导研究中心那台一样，黑灰色机箱，是四年前出品的RX8620。把这台价值上百万的设备放在家里似乎很奇怪，魏成每天一个人守着它到底在干什么？    “玉菲在上面有点事，您稍等一会儿吧。”魏成说，然后走上楼。汪淼本打算等的，但实在坐不住，也跟着走上楼去，看到魏成正要进入他那个放着小型机的房间。他看到汪淼跟来似乎并不反感，指指对面的一个房间说：“哦，就在那个房间里，你去找她吧。”    汪淼敲门，门没锁，开了一个缝，他看到申玉菲正坐在电脑前玩游戏，令汪淼惊奇的是她竟穿着一套“V装具”。这是目前在游戏玩家中很流行的玩意儿，由一个全视角显示头盔和一套感应服构成，感应服可以使玩家从肉体上感觉到游戏中的击打、刀刺和火烧，能产生出酷热和严寒，甚至还能逼真地模拟出身体暴露在风雪中的感觉。汪淼走到她后面，由于游戏是在头盔中以全视角方式显示的，在显示器上什么都看不到。这时，汪淼想起大史让他记网址和邮件地址的事，无意中扫了一眼显示器，那个游戏登录界面上的英文名很特别，他记住了。    申玉菲摘下显示头盔，又脱下了感应服，戴上她那副在瘦削的脸上显得很大的眼镜，面无表情地对汪淼点点头，一个字都没说，等着他说话。汪淼拿出那团胶卷，开始讲述发生在自己身上的诡异事件。申玉菲注意听着，对那些胶片，只是拿起来大概扫了几眼，并没有细看——这令汪淼很震惊，现在他进一步确定申玉菲对此事并非完全不知情，这几乎令他停止了讲述，只是申玉菲几次点头示意他继续，才将事情讲完了。这时申玉菲才说出了他们见面后的第一句话：    “你领导的纳米项目怎么样了？”    这不着边际的问题令汪淼十分吃惊。“纳米项目？它与这有什么关系？”他指指那堆胶卷。    申玉菲没有说话，只是静静地看着他，等他回答自己的问题。这就是她的谈话风格，从不多说一个字。    “把研究停下来。”申玉菲说。    “什么？”汪淼认为自己听错了，“你说什么？”    申玉菲沉默着，没重复自己的话。    “停下来？！那是国家重点项目！”    申玉菲仍不说话，只是看着他，目光平静。    “你总得说出原因吧！”    “停下来试试。”    “你到底知道些什么？告诉我！”    “我能告诉你的就这些了。”    “项目不能停，也不可能停！”    “停下来试试。”    关于幽灵倒计时的简短谈话就到此为止，之后，不管汪淼如何努力，申玉菲再也没有说出一个与此有关的字，只是重复那句话：“停下来试试。”    “我现在明白了，‘科学边界’并不是像你们宣称的那样是一个基础理论的学术交流组织，它与现实的关系比我想象的要复杂得多。”汪淼说。    “相反，你得出这个印象，是因为‘科学边界’涉及的东西比你想象的更基础。”    绝望的汪淼没有告辞起身就走，申玉菲默默地一直送他到庭院的大门处，并看着他坐进出租车。正在这时，另一辆汽车疾驰而来，在门前刹住了。一个男人下车，借着别墅中透出的灯光，汪淼一眼就认出了他。    这人是潘寒，是“科学边界”里最著名的人物之一。作为一名生物学家，他成功地预言了长期食用转基因农产品造成的后代遗传畸形，还预言了转基因作物可能造成的生态灾难。与那些空洞地危言耸听的学者不同，他的预言充满了具体的细节，且都一一精确兑现，其准确度达到令人震惊的程度，以至于有传言说他来自未来。    他使自己闻名于世的另一个创举，是创建了国内第一个实验社会。与西方那些旨在回归自然的乌托邦社团不同，他的“中华田园”不是处于荒野之地，而是置身于最大的城市中。社团没有一分钱财产，包括食物在内的所有生活用品，均来自城市垃圾。与人们最初的预想不同，“中华田园”不但生存下来，而且迅速壮大，其固定成员已达三千多人，不定期到其中体验生活的人更是不计其数。1    以这两个成功为基础，潘寒的社会思想也日益具有影响力。他认为，科技革命是人类社会的一种病变，技术的爆炸性发展与癌细胞的飞速扩散相当，最终的结果都是耗尽有机体的养分，破坏器官，导致其寄宿体的死亡。他主张废除那些“粗暴的”技术，如化石能源和核电，保留“温和的”技术，如太阳能和小水电。将大城市逐步解散，人口均匀分布于自给自足的小村镇中，以“温和技术”为基础，建立“新农业社会”。4    “他在吗？”潘寒指指别墅的二楼问。    申玉菲没有回答，沉默地挡在他面前。    “我要警告他，当然也要警告你，别逼我们！”潘寒冷冷地说。    申玉菲仍没回答他，只是对出租车里的汪淼说：“走吧，没事。”然后示意司机开车。车发动后，汪淼再也没有听到他们说什么，他回头远远地看到，灯光下申玉菲一直没让潘寒走进别墅。    回到家已是深夜，汪淼在小区的门口走下出租车，一辆黑色桑塔纳紧贴着他刹住，车窗摇下，一股烟喷了出来，是大史，粗壮的身躯将驾驶座挤得满满的。    “哇，汪教授，汪院士！这两天过得可好？”    “你在跟踪我？真无聊！”    “别误会，我要是直直开过去不就完了，讲个礼貌打个招呼你还当成驴肝肺了。”大史露出他的特色傻笑，一副无赖相，“咋的，那边看到什么有用的信息没，交流交流？”    “我说过，我和你们没关系了，今后请不要跟踪我！”    “得——”大史开动了车子，“好像我愿意挣这俩夜班外勤费似的，球赛都耽误了。”    汪淼走进家门，妻儿已经睡了，他听到妻子在床上不安地翻身，嘴里发出模糊不清的声音，丈夫今天怪异的举动，不知会给她带来怎样的噩梦。汪淼吃了两片利眠灵，躺到床上，过了很长时间才艰难地进入梦乡。    他的梦境很纷乱，但其中的一个东西却恒定地存在着：幽灵倒计时。其实，倒计时在梦中出现是汪淼早就预料到的事。梦境中，他疯狂地击打悬浮在半空的倒计时，撕它、咬它，但一切击打都无力地穿透了它，它就悬在梦境正中，坚定地流逝着。它使汪淼烦躁至极，终于从梦中醒来。    他睁开眼，看到了模糊的天花板，外面城市的灯光透过窗帘，在上面投出黯淡的光晕。但有一样东西从梦中跟随他到现实中：幽灵倒计时。倒计时仍在他睁开的眼睛前显现，数字很细，但很亮，发出一种烧灼的白光。    1185:11:34、1185:11:33、1185:11:32、1185:11:31……    汪淼转转头，看到了卧室中模糊的一切，确认自己已经醒来，倒计时没有消失。他闭上双眼，倒计时仍显现在他那完全黑暗的视野中，像黑天鹅绒上发亮的水银。他再次睁眼，并揉揉眼睛，倒计时仍没有消失，不管他的视线如何移动，那一串数字稳稳地占据着视野的正中央。    一股莫名的恐惧使汪淼猛地坐起来，倒计时死死跟随着他。他跳下床，冲到窗前，扯开窗帘，推开窗。外面沉睡中的城市仍然灯光灿烂，倒计时就在这广阔的背景前显现着，像电影画面上的字幕。    一时间，汪淼感到自己窒息了，不由发出一声低沉的惊叫。面对被惊醒的妻子恐慌的探问，他努力使自己镇定下来，安慰妻子说没什么，又躺回床上，闭上眼睛，在幽灵倒计时的照耀下艰难地度过了剩下的夜晚。    清晨起床后，汪淼努力使自己在家人面前显得正常些，但妻子还是看出了异样，问他的眼睛怎么了？是不是看不清东西？    早饭后，汪淼向纳米中心请了假，开车去医院。一路上，幽灵倒计时无情地横在他眼中的现实世界前面，这东西会自动调节自己的亮度，在不同的背景上都清晰地显现出来。汪淼甚至盯着初升的太阳，试图使倒计时被强光暂时隐没一会儿，但没有用，那串魔鬼数字竟在日轮上显现出来，这时它不是增加亮度，而是变成黑色，更加恐怖。    同仁医院很难挂号，汪淼直接找了妻子的一个同学，一位著名的眼科专家。他没有说病情，而是先让医生检查自己的眼睛。仔细检查了汪淼的双眼后，医生告诉他没有发现什么病变，眼睛一切正常。    “我的眼睛总是看见一个东西，不管你看哪里，这东西都在。”汪淼说。同时，那串数字就横在医生脸前。    1175:11:34、1175:11:33、1175:11:32、1175:11:31……    “飞蚊症。”医生说，同时抽出处方签开始写，“我们这年纪的常见眼病，晶状体混浊。不太好治，但没什么要紧的，开些碘药水和维D吧，也许能吸收掉，但希望不大。不过，这确实没什么要紧的，只要你习惯了忽略视野里的那些杂物，对视力没什么影响。”    “你说的飞蚊症，那些……东西看上去是什么样子？”    “不规则，因人而异，有时是小黑点儿，有时像蝌蚪。”    “如果看到的是一串数字呢？”    医生写处方的笔停了。“你看到一串数字？”    “是的，横在视野中心。”    医生推开纸和笔，关切地看着他，“一进来我就看出，你过度劳累。上次同学聚会，李瑶向我提起你，说你的工作压力很大。到我们这岁数，应该注意了，健康可透支不起了。”    “你是说，我这是精神因素所致？”    医生点点头，“要是一般的病人，我就建议他去精神科了，其实没必要，没什么要紧的，就是太累了。休息几天吧，去度几天假，和李瑶、孩子，叫什么来着，豆豆吧，一起去。放心，很快会恢复的。”    1175:10:02、1175:10:01、1175:10:00，1175:09:59……    “我告诉你我看到的是什么，一个倒计时！一秒一秒，在精确地走！这会是精神因素？”    医生宽容地笑笑，“想知道精神因素能对视力影响到什么程度吗？上个月我们收治了一个女孩儿，十五六岁吧，她在教室里突然间什么都看不见了，完全失明。可经过所有检查，眼睛在生理上完全正常。后来精神科的专家对她进行了一个月的心理治疗，又是突然间，她的眼睛恢复到正常的视力水平。”    汪淼知道在这里是浪费时间，他起身要走，最后说：“好吧，不管我的眼睛，我只有一个问题想请教你：有什么外力，能通过远程作用使人看到什么吗？”    医生想了想说：“有，我前一阵儿参加神舟19号的医疗组，曾有航天员报告说，他们在舱外工作时看到了并不存在的闪光。以前国际空间站上的航天员报告过类似情况，都是在太阳活动剧烈的时候，太空中的高能粒子打到视网膜上，人就看到闪耀。不过你说的看到数字，还是倒计时，绝无可能是这个原因。”汪淼恍惚地走出医院，倒计时就在他眼前，他似乎在跟着它走，跟着一个死死缠着他的鬼魂。他买了一副墨镜戴上，仅仅是为了不让别人看到自己梦游般迷离的眼神。    汪淼走进纳米中心的主体实验室，进门之前没忘记把墨镜摘下来，尽管这样，遇见他的同事都对他的精神状态露出担心的神色。    在实验大厅中央，汪淼看到反应黑箱仍在运行中。这台巨型设备的主体是汇集了大量管道的一个球体。代号叫“飞刃”的超强度纳米材料已经生产出来，但是用分子建筑术制造的，就是用分子探针将材料分子像砌砖那样一个个垒砌起来，这样的工艺要耗费大量的资源，那些产品可以说是世界上最贵重的珍宝了，根本无法进行量产。    实验室现在做的，就是试图通过一种催化反应来代替分子建筑法，使巨量的分子在反应中同时完成筑砌。试验就是在反应黑箱中进行的，这台设备可以在数量庞大的成分组合上进行反应试验，这样数量的组合如果用传统的人工操作可能上百年也做不完，但在反应黑箱中可以快速自动进行。同时，这是一种集现实反应与数字模拟一体化的设备，当合成进行到一定程度时，计算机会根据反应的阶段性结果建立起合成反应的数字模型，将剩下的反应进程用数字模拟代替，大大提高了实验效率。    实验主任见到汪淼后，急匆匆走过来，开始汇报反应黑箱刚出现的一系列故障。这是近来汪淼一上班就遇到的事。现在，反应黑箱连续运行了一年多，许多传感器灵敏度下降，误差增大，急需停机维护。但身为项目首席科学家的汪淼坚持做完第三批合成组合再停机，工程师们只好在反应黑箱上加入越来越多的补偿修正装置，到现在这些装置本身也需要补偿修正，搞得整个项目组疲惫不堪。但主任小心翼翼地没提停机和暂停试验的事，怕汪淼又像上几次那样大发雷霆。他只是把困难都摆出来，意思也很明白。    汪淼抬头看看反应黑箱，觉得它像一个子宫，工程师们正围着它忙碌，艰难地维持着正常的运行。在这场景前面，叠现着幽灵倒计时。    1174:21:11、1174:21:10、1174:21:09、1174:21:08……    停下来试试。汪淼脑海中突然响起申玉菲的话。    “全面更新外围传感系统需要多长时间？”他问。    “四五天吧，”实验主任突然看到了希望，赶紧加一句，“快些干，三天就行，汪总，我保证！”    我并没有屈服，设备确实需要维修，因而试验必须暂停，与别的无关。汪淼在心里对自己说，然后转向主任，透过倒计时的数字看着他，“把试验停下来吧，停机维修，就照你说的时间表。”    “好的汪总，我会很快给你一份更新方案，下午就能停机了！”主任兴奋地说。    “现在就停吧。”    主任像不认识似的看着汪淼，但旋即恢复了兴奋状态，好像生怕失掉这个机会似的。他拿起电话下了停机命令，项目组里那些疲惫的研究员和工程师一下子都兴奋起来，开始按程序扳动上百个复杂的开关，众多的监控屏一个接一个地黑了下来，最后，主监控屏上显示了停机状态。    几乎与此同时，汪淼眼前的倒计时停止了走动，数字固定为1174:20:35。几秒钟后，数字闪动了几下，消失了。    当没有幽灵倒计时覆盖的现实重现眼前时，汪淼长出了一口气，像刚从水底挣扎出来一样。他无力地坐下，很快意识到旁边还有人在看着他。    他对实验主任说：“系统更新是设备部的事，你们实验组的人好好休息几天吧，这一阵大家都辛苦了。”    “汪总，你也太累了，这里有张总工程师盯着，你也回家好好休息一下吧。”    “是啊，太累了。”汪淼无力地说，待他离开后，拿起电话，拨了申玉菲的号码，只响了一声铃她就接了。    “你们背后是什么？”汪淼问，尽量使自己的声音冷静一些，但没有做到。    沉默。    “倒计时的尽头是什么？”    沉默。    “你在听吗？”    “在。”    “高强度纳米材料怎么了？这不是高能加速器，只是一项应用研究，值得这样关注么？”    “什么值得关注，不应由我们来判断。”    “够了！”汪淼大吼一声，心中的恐惧和绝望突然化为疯狂的怒气，“你们以为这点小魔术就能骗得了我？就能阻止技术进步！？我承认一时无法做出技术上的解释，但那是因为我还没有绕到那个可耻魔术师的背后！”    “你的意思，是想在更大的尺度上看到倒计时？”    申玉菲的话让汪淼愣了一下，他对这个问题没有准备，于是强迫自己冷静下来，以免落入圈套。“收起你那套把戏吧。大尺度又怎么样，你们同样可以玩魔术！可以向天空投映全息图像，就像上一次战争中北约做的那样，强力激光甚至可以将图像映满整个月球表面！射手和农场主应该能够玩弄人类力不能及的更大尺度，比如，倒计时能够显示到太阳表面吗？”话刚说完，汪淼吃惊地张大了嘴，他竟在下意识中说出了那两个这时应十分忌讳的名词，还好，没有说出更忌讳的那个。他想争取更多的主动性，于是接着说，“考虑到某种我还没想到的可能性，即使在太阳的尺度上，你们那个可耻魔术师仍有可能耍魔术，那种力量要真正令人信服，显示的尺度还需更大些。”    “问题是你能承受得了吗？我们是朋友，我想帮你，别走杨冬的路。”    听到这个名字，汪淼不由打了个寒战，但随之而来的愤怒又使他不顾一切了：“能接受这个挑战吗？”    “能。”    “你想怎么样？”汪淼的声音变得无力了。    “你旁边有上网的电脑吗？好，进这个网址：    汪淼看到网页上显示的只是一张莫尔斯电码对照表。    “我不明白，这是……”    “在以后的两天内，设法找到一个能够观测宇宙背景辐射的地方。具体的请看我随后发给你的电子邮件。”    “这是……干什么呢？”    “我知道纳米研究项目已经停了，你打算重新启动它吗？”    “当然，三天以后。”    “那倒计时将继续。”    “我将在什么尺度上看到它？”    沉默良久，这个为某种超出人类理解力的力量代言的女人，冷酷地封死了汪淼的一切出路。    “三天后，也就是十四日，在凌晨一点钟至五点钟，整个宇宙将为你闪烁。”')

            '汪淼拨通了丁仪的电话，对方接听后，他才想起现在已是凌晨一点多了。2    “我是汪淼，真对不起，这么晚打扰。”    “没关系，我正失眠。”    “我……遇到一些事，想请你帮个忙。你知道国内有观测宇宙背景辐射的机构吗？”汪淼产生了一种倾诉的欲望，但旋即觉得幽灵倒计时之事目前还是不要让更多的人知道为好。    “宇宙背景辐射？你怎么对这个有雅兴？看来你真的遇到一些事了……你去看过杨冬的母亲吗？”2    “啊——真对不起，我忘了。”    “没关系，现在科学界，很多人都……像你说的那样遇到了一些事，心不在焉的。不过你最好还是去看看她，她年纪大了，又不愿雇保姆，要是有什么费力气的事麻烦你帮着干干……哦，宇宙背景辐射的事，你正好可以去找杨冬的母亲问问，她退休前是搞天体物理专业的，与国内的这类研究机构很熟。”    “好好，我今天下班就去。”    “那先谢谢了，我是真的无法再面对与杨冬有关的一切了。”    打完电话后，汪淼坐到电脑前，开始打印网页上显示的那张很简单的莫尔斯电码对照表。这时他已经冷静下来，将思绪从倒计时上移开，想着关于“科学边界”和申玉菲的事，想到她玩的网络游戏。关于申玉菲，他能肯定的唯一一件事就是她不是爱玩游戏的人，这个说话如电报般精简的女人给他唯一的印象就是冷，她的冷与其他的某些女性不同，不是一张面具，而是从里到外冷透了。    汪淼总是下意识地将她与早已消失的DOS操作系统联系在一起，一面空荡荡的黑屏幕，只有一个简单得不能再简单的“C:＞”提示符在闪动，你输入什么它就输出什么，一个字都不会多，也不会有变化。现在他知道，“C:＞”提示符后面其实是一个无底深渊。    她真会有兴致玩游戏，而且是戴着V装具玩儿？她没有孩子，那套V装具只能是自己买回去用的，这有些不可思议。    汪淼在浏览器的地址栏中输入那个很容易记住的游戏网址：www.threebody.com，网页上显示该游戏只支持V装具方式。汪淼想起了纳米中心的职工娱乐室里好像有一套V装具，就走出已经空荡荡的中心实验大厅，去值班室要了钥匙，在娱乐室中穿过一排台球桌和健身器材，在一台电脑旁找到了V装具，费了很大劲才把感应服穿上，然后戴上显示头盔，启动电脑。2    启动游戏后，汪淼置身于一片黎明之际的荒原，荒原呈暗褐色，细节看不清楚，远方地平线上有一小片白色的曙光，其余的天空则群星闪烁。一声巨响，两座发着红光的山峰砸落到远方的大地上，整个荒原笼罩在红色光芒之中。被激起的遮天蔽日的尘埃散去后，汪淼看清了那两个顶天立地的大字：三体。    随后出现了一个注册界面，汪淼用“海人”这个ID注册，然后成功登录。    荒原依旧，但V装具感应服中的压缩机咝咝地启动了，汪淼感到一股逼人的寒气。前方出现了两个行走的人影，在曙光的背景前呈黑色的剪影。汪淼追了上去，他看到两人都是男性，披着破烂的长袍，外面还裹着一张肮脏的兽皮，都带着一把青铜时代那种又宽又短的剑，其中一人背着一只有他一半高的细长的木箱子。那人扭头看看汪淼，他的脸像那兽皮一样脏和皱，双眼却很有神，眸子映着曙光。“冷啊。”他说。    “是，真冷。”汪淼附和道。    “这是战国时代，我是周文王。”那人说。    “周文王不是战国时代的人吧？”汪淼问。    “他一直活到现在呢，纣王也活着。”另一个没背箱子的人说，“我是周文王的追随者，我的ID就叫‘周文王追随者’，他可是个天才。”    “我的ID是‘海人’，”汪淼说，“您背的是什么？”    周文王放下那只长方形木箱，将一个立面像一扇门似的打开，露出里面的五层方格，借着晨曦的微光，汪淼看到每层之间都有高低不等的一小堆细沙，每格中都有从上一格流下的一道涓细的沙流。    “沙漏，八小时漏完一次，颠倒三次就是一天，不过我常常忘了颠倒，要靠追随者提醒。”周文王介绍说。    “你们好像是在长途旅行，有必要背这么笨重的计时器吗？”    “那怎么计时呢？”    “拿个小型的日晷多方便，或者干脆只看太阳也能知道大概的时间。”    周文王和追随者面面相觑，然后一起盯着汪淼，好像他是个白痴，“太阳？看太阳怎么能知道时间？这可是乱纪元。”    汪淼正要询问这个怪异名词的含义，追随者哀鸣道：“真冷啊，冷死我了！”    汪淼也觉得冷，但他不能随便脱下感应服，一般情况下，那样做会被游戏注销ID的。他说：“太阳出来就会暖和些的。”    “你在冒充伟大的先知吗？连周文王都不算先知呢！”追随者冲汪淼不屑地摇摇头。    “这需要先知吗？谁还看不出来太阳一两个小时后就会升起。”汪淼指指天边说。    “这是乱纪元！”追随者说。    “什么是乱纪元？”    “除了恒纪元，都是乱纪元。”周文王说，像回答一个无知孩童的提问。    果然，天边的晨光开始暗下去，很快消失了，夜幕重新笼罩了一切，苍穹星光灿烂。    “原来现在是黄昏不是早晨？”汪淼问。    “是早晨，早晨太阳不一定能升起，这是乱纪元。”    寒冷使汪淼很难受。“看这样子，太阳要很长时间以后才会升出来。”他哆嗦着指指模糊的地平线说。    “你怎么又会有这种想法？那可不一定，这是乱纪元。”追随者说着转向周文王，“姬昌，给我些鱼干吃吧。”    “不行！”周文王断然说道，“我也是勉强吃饱，要保证我能走到朝歌，而不是你。”    说话间，汪淼注意到另一个方向的地平线又出现了曙光，他分不清东南西北，但肯定不是上次出现时的方向。这曙光很快增强，不一会儿，这个世界的太阳升起来了，是一颗蓝色的小太阳，很像增强了亮度的月亮，但还是让汪淼感到了一丝温暖，并看清了大地的细节。但这个白昼很短暂，太阳在地平线上方划了一道浅浅的弧形就落下了，夜色和寒冷又笼罩了一切。    三人在一棵枯树前停下，周文王和追随者拔出青铜剑来砍柴，汪淼将碎柴收集到一块。追随者拿出火镰，噼啪、噼啪打了好一阵，升起了一堆火。汪淼的感应服的前胸部分变暖和了，但背后仍然冰冷。    “烧些脱水者，火才旺呢。”追随者说。    “住嘴！那是纣王干的事！”    “反正路上那些散落的，都破成那样，泡不活了。如果你的理论真能行，别说烧一些，吃一些都成，与那理论相比，几条命算什么。”    “胡说！我们是学者！”    篝火燃尽后，三人继续赶路。由于他们之间交谈很少，系统加快了游戏时间的流逝速度，周文王很快将背上的沙漏翻了六下，转眼间两天过去了，太阳还没有升起过一次，甚至天边连曙光的影子都没有。    “看来太阳不会出来了。”汪淼说，同时调出游戏界面来看了一下自己的HP，它正因寒冷而迅速减小。    “你又冒充伟大的先知了……”追随者说，汪淼和他一起说出了后半句，“这是乱纪元！”    这话说完不久，天边真的出现了曙光，并且迅速增强，转眼间太阳就升了起来。汪淼发现这次升起的是一颗大太阳，当它升至一半时，直径占了视野内至少五分之一的地平线。暖流扑面而来，令汪淼心旷神怡，但他看周文王和追随者时，发现他们都一脸惊恐，仿佛魔鬼降临。    “快，找阴凉地儿！”追随者大喊，汪淼跟着他们飞奔，跑到了一处低矮的岩石后面蹲下来。岩石的阴影在渐渐缩短，周围的大地像处于白炽状态般刺眼，脚下的冻土迅速融化，由坚硬如铁变成泥泞一片，热浪滚滚。汪淼很快出汗了。当大太阳升到头顶正上方时，三人用兽皮蒙住头，强光仍如利箭般从所有缝隙和孔洞中射进来。三人绕着岩石挪到另一边，躲进那边刚刚出现的阴影中……    太阳落山后，空气依然异常闷热，大汗淋漓的三人坐在岩石上，追随者沮丧地说：“乱纪元旅行，真是在地狱里走路，我受不了了；再说我也没吃的了，你不分我些鱼干，又不让吃脱水者，唉——”    “那你只能脱水了。”周文王说，一手用兽皮扇着风。    “脱水以后，你不会扔下我吧？”    “当然不会，我保证把你带到朝歌。”    追随者脱下了被汗水浸湿的长袍，赤身躺到泥地上。在落日的余晖中，汪淼看到追随者身上的汗水突然增加了，他很快知道那不是出汗，这人身体内的水分正在被彻底排出，这些水在沙地上形成了几条小小的溪流，追随者的整个躯体如一根熔化的蜡烛在变软变薄……十分钟后水排完了，那躯体化为一张人形的软皮一动不动地铺在泥地上，面部的五官都模糊不清了。    “他死了吗？”汪淼问。他想起来了，一路上不时看到有这样的人形软皮，有的已破损不全，那就是不久前追随者想要用来烧火的脱水者。    “没有。”周文王说着，将追随者变成的软皮拎起来，拍了拍上面的土，放到岩石上将他（它）卷起来，就像卷一只放了气的皮球一般，“在水里泡一会儿，他就会恢复原状活过来，就像泡干蘑菇那样。”    “他的骨骼也变软了？”    “是的，都成了干纤维，这样便于携带。”    “这个世界中的每个人都能脱水吗？”    “当然，你也能，要不，在乱纪元是活不下去的。”周文王将卷好的追随者递给汪淼，“你带着他吧，扔到路上不是被人烧了，就是吃了。”    汪淼接过软皮，很轻的一小卷，用胳膊夹着倒也没有什么异样的感觉。    汪淼夹着脱水的追随者，周文王背着沙漏，两人继续着艰难的旅程。同前几天一样，这个世界中的太阳运行得完全没有规律，在连续几个严寒的长夜后，可能会突然出现一个酷热的白天，或者相反。两人相依为命，在篝火边抵御严寒，泡在湖水中度过酷热。好在游戏时间可以加快，一个月可以在半小时内过完，这使得乱纪元的旅程还是可以忍受的。    这天，漫漫长夜已延续了近一个星期（按沙漏计时），周文王突然指着夜空欢呼起来：    “飞星！飞星！两颗飞星！！”    其实，汪淼之前就注意到那种奇怪的天体，它比星星大，能显出乒乓球大小的圆盘形状，运行速度很快，肉眼能明显地看到它在星空中移动，只是这次出现了两个。    周文王解释说：“两颗飞星出现，恒纪元就要开始了！”    “以前看到过的。”    “那只有一个。”    “最多只有两个吗？”    “不，有时会有三个，但不会再多了。”    “三颗飞星出现，是不是预示着更美好的纪元？”    周文王用充满恐惧的眼神瞪了汪淼一眼，“你在说什么呀，三颗飞星……祈祷它不要出现吧。”    周文王的话没错，他们向往的恒纪元很快开始了，太阳升起落下开始变得有规律，一个昼夜渐渐固定在十八小时左右，日夜有规律的交替使天气变得暖和了一些。    “恒纪元能持续多长时间？”汪淼问。    “一天或一个世纪，每次多长谁都说不准。”周文王坐在沙漏上，仰头看着正午的太阳，“据记载，西周曾有过长达两个世纪的恒纪元，唉，生在那个时代的人有福啊。”    “那乱纪元会持续多长时间呢？”    “不是说过嘛，除了恒纪元都是乱纪元，两者互为对方的间隙。”    “那就是说，这是一个全无规律的混乱世界？！”    “是的，文明只能在较长的气候温暖的恒纪元里发展。大部分时间里，人类集体脱水存贮起来，当较长的恒纪元到来时，再集体浸泡复活，生产和建设。”    “那怎样预知每个恒纪元到来的时间和长短呢？”    “做不到，从来没有做到过。当恒纪元到来时，国家是否浸泡取决于大王的直觉，常常是：浸泡复活了，庄稼种下了，城镇开始修筑，生活刚刚开始，恒纪元就结束了，严寒和酷热就毁灭了一切。”周文王说到这里，一手指向汪淼，双眼变得炯炯有神，“好了，你已经知道了这个游戏的目标：就是运用我们的智力和悟性，分析研究各种现象，掌握太阳运行的规律，文明的生存就维系于此。”    “在我看来太阳运行根本就没有规律。”    “那是因为你没能悟出世界的本原。”    “你悟出来了？”    “是的，这就是我去朝歌的目的，我将为纣王献上一份精确的万年历。”    “可这一路上，没看到你有这种能力。”    “对太阳运行规律的预测只能在朝歌做出，因为那里是阴阳的交汇点，只有在那里取的卦才是准确的。”两人又在严酷的乱纪元跋涉了很长时间，其间又经历了一次短暂的恒纪元，终于到达了朝歌。    汪淼听到一种不间断的类似于雷声的轰鸣。这声音是朝歌大地上许多奇怪的东西发出的，那是一座座巨大的单摆，每座都有几十米高。单摆的摆锤是一块块巨石，被一大束绳索吊在架于两座细高石塔间的天桥上。每座单摆都在摆动中。驱动它们的是一群群身穿盔甲的士兵，他们合着奇怪的号子，齐力拉动系在巨石摆锤上的绳索，维持着它的摆动。汪淼发现，所有巨摆的摆动都是同步的，远远看去，这景象怪异得使人着迷，像大地上竖立着一座座走动的钟表，又像从天而降的许多巨大、抽象的符号。    在巨摆的环绕下，有一座巨大的金字塔，夜幕中如同一座高耸的黑山，这就是纣王的宫殿。汪淼跟着周文王走进了金字塔基座上的一个不高的洞门，门旁几名守卫的士兵在黑暗中如幽灵般无声地徘徊。他们沿着一条长长的隧道向里走，隧道窄而黑，间隔很远才有一支火炬。    “在乱纪元，整个国家在脱水中，但纣王一直醒着，陪伴着这片没有生机的国土。要想在乱纪元生存，就得居住在这种墙壁极厚的建筑中，几乎像住在地下，才能避开严寒和酷热。”周文王边走边对汪淼解释。    走了很长的路，才进入了纣王位于金字塔中心的大殿，其实这里并不大，很像一个山洞。身披一大张花兽皮坐在一处高台上的人显然是纣王了，但首先吸引汪淼目光的是一位黑衣人，他的黑衣几乎与大殿中浓重的阴影融为一体，那张苍白的脸仿佛是浮在虚空中。    “这是伏羲。”纣王对刚进来的周文王和汪淼介绍那位黑衣人，仿佛他们一直就在那儿似的，而黑衣人才是新来的，“他认为，太阳是脾气乖戾的大神，他醒着的时候喜怒无常，是乱纪元；睡着时呼吸均匀，是恒纪元。伏義建议竖起了外面的那些大摆，日夜不停地摆动，声称这对太阳神有强烈的催眠作用，能使其陷入漫长的昏睡。但直到现在，我们看到太阳神仍醒着，最多只是不时打打盹儿。”    纣王挥了一下手，有人端来一个陶罐，放到伏義面前的小石台上——汪淼后来知道，那是一罐调味料。伏義长叹一声，端起陶罐喝下去，那咕咚咕咚的声音仿佛黑暗深处有一颗硕大的心脏在跳动。喝了一半后，他将剩下的调味料倒在身上，然后扔下陶罐，走向大殿角落的一口架在火上的青铜大鼎，爬上鼎沿；他跳进大鼎，激起了一大团蒸气。    “姬昌坐下，一会儿就开宴。”纣王指指那口大鼎说。    “愚蠢的巫术。”周文王朝大鼎偏了下头，轻蔑地说。    “你对太阳悟出了什么？”纣王问，火光在他的双眸中跳动。    “太阳不是大神，太阳是阳，黑夜是阴，世界是在阴阳平衡中运转的，这不在我们的控制之中，但可以预测。”周文王说着，抽出青铜剑，在火炬照到的地板上画出了一对大大的阴阳鱼，然后以令人目眩的速度在周围画出了六十四卦，看上去如同火光中时隐时现的大年轮，“大王，这就是宇宙的密码，借助它，我将为您的王朝献上一部精确的万年历。”    “姬昌啊，我现在急需知道的，是下一个长恒纪元什么时候到来。”    “我将立刻为您占卜。”周文王说着，走到阴阳鱼中央盘腿坐下，抬头望着大殿的顶部，目光仿佛穿透了厚厚的金字塔看到了星空，他的双手手指同时在进行着复杂的运动，组合成一部高速运转的计算器。寂静中，只有大鼎中的汤发出咕嘟咕嘟的声响，仿佛煮在汤中的巫师在梦呓。    周文王从阴阳图中站起来，头仍仰着，说：“下面将是一段为期四十一天的乱纪元，然后将出现为期五天的恒纪元，接下来是为期二十三天的乱纪元和为期十八天的恒纪元，然后是为期八天的乱纪元，当这段乱纪元结束后，大王，您所期待的长恒纪元就到来了，这个恒纪元将持续三年零九个月，其间气候温暖，是一个黄金纪元。”    “我们首先需要证实一下你前面的预测。”纣王不动声色地说。    汪淼听到上方传来一阵轰隆隆的声音，大殿顶上的一块石板滑开，露出一处正方形的洞口，汪淼调整方向，看到这个方洞通到金字塔的外面，在这个方洞的尽头，汪淼看到了几颗闪烁的星星。    游戏的时间加快了，由两名士兵看守的周文王带来的沙漏几秒钟就翻动一次，标志着八小时的流逝。上方的窗口无规律地闪烁起来，不时有一束乱纪元的阳光射进大殿，有时很微弱，如月光一般；有时则十分强烈，投在地上的方形光斑白炽明亮，使所有的火炬黯然失色。汪淼数着沙漏翻动的次数，当翻到一百二十次左右时，阳光投进窗口的间隔变得规则了，预测中的第一个恒纪元到来。沙漏再翻动十五下后，窗口的闪烁又紊乱起来，乱纪元又开始了。然后又是恒纪元，然后又是乱纪元，它们的开始和持续时间虽然有些小误差，但与周文王的预测已是相当的吻合了。当最后一段为期八天的乱纪元结束后，他预言的长恒纪元开始了。汪淼数着沙漏的翻动，二十天过去了，射进大殿的日光仍遵循着精确的节奏。这时，游戏时间的流逝被调整到正常。    纣王向周文王点点头：“姬昌啊，我将为你树起一座丰碑，比这座宫殿还要高大。”    周文王深鞠一躬：“我的大王，让您的王朝苏醒吧，繁荣吧！”    纣王在石台上站起身，张开双臂，仿佛要拥抱整个世界，他用一种很奇怪的歌唱般的音调喊道：“浸泡——”    听到这号令，大殿内的人都跑向洞门。在周文王的示意下，汪淼跟着他沿着长长的隧道向金字塔外走去。走出洞门，汪淼看到时值正午，太阳在当空静静地照耀着大地，微风吹过，他似乎嗅到了春天的气息。周文王和汪淼一同来到了距金字塔不远的一处湖畔，湖面上的冰已融化了，阳光在微波间跳动。    先出来的一队士兵高呼着：“浸泡！浸泡！”都奔向湖边一处形似谷仓的高大石砌建筑。在来的路上，汪淼不时在远处看到过这种建筑，周文王告诉他那是“干仓”，是存贮脱水人的大型仓库。士兵们打开干仓的石门，从中搬出一卷卷落满灰尘的皮卷，他们每人都抱着、夹着好几个皮卷，走向湖边，将那些皮卷扔进湖中。那些皮卷一遇到水，立刻舒展开来，一时间，湖面上漂浮着一片似乎是剪出来的薄薄的人形。每一张“人片”都在迅速吸水膨胀，渐渐地，湖面上的“人片”都变成了圆润的肉体，这些肉体很快具有了生命的迹象，一个个挣扎着从齐腰深的湖水中站立起来。他们睁大如梦初醒的眼睛看着这风和日丽的世界。“浸泡！”一个人高呼起来，立刻引来了一片欢呼声：“浸泡！浸泡！！”……这些人从湖中跑上岸，赤身裸体地奔向干仓，将更多的皮卷投入湖中，浸泡复活的人一群群从湖中跑出来。这一幕也发生在更远处的湖泊和池塘中，整个世界在复活。    “噢，天啊！我的指头——”    汪淼顺着声音看去，见一个刚浸泡复活的人站在湖中，举着一只手哭喊道，那手缺了中指，血从手上断指处滴到湖中。其他复活者纷纷拥过他的身边，兴高采烈地奔向湖岸，没有人注意他。    “行了，你就知足吧！”一个经过的复活者说，“有人整条胳膊腿都没了，有人脑袋被咬了个洞，如果再不浸泡，我们怕是都要被乱纪元的老鼠啃光了！”    “我们脱水多长时间了？”另一位复活者问。    “看看大王宫殿上积的沙尘有多厚就知道了，刚听说现在的大王已不是脱水前的大王了，不知是他的儿子还是孙子。”    浸泡持续了八天才完全结束，这时所有的脱水人都已复活，世界又一次获得了新生。这八天中，人们享受着每天二十个小时、周期准确的日出日落。沐浴在春天的气息里，所有人都衷心地赞美太阳、赞美掌管宇宙的诸神。第八天夜里，大地上的篝火比天上的星星都密，在漫长的乱纪元中荒废的城镇又充满了灯火和喧闹，同文明以前的无数次浸泡一样，所有人将彻夜狂欢，迎接日出后的新生活。    但太阳再也没有升起来。    各种计时器都表明日出的时间已过，但各个方向的地平线都仍是漆黑一片。又过了十个小时，没有太阳的影子，连最微弱的晨光都见不到。一天过去了，无边的夜在继续着；两天过去了，寒冷像一只巨掌在暗夜中压向大地。    “请大王相信我，这只是暂时的，我看到了宇宙中的阳在聚集，太阳就要升起来了，恒纪元和春天将继续！”金字塔的大殿里，周文王跪在纣王端坐的石台下哀求道。    “还是把鼎烧上吧。”纣王叹了口气说。    “大王！大王！”一名大臣从洞门里跌跌撞撞地跑进来，带着哭腔喊道，“天上，天上有三颗飞星！！”    大殿中的所有人都惊呆了，空气仿佛凝固了，只有纣王仍然不动声色。他转向以前一直不屑于搭理的汪淼，“你还不知道出现三颗飞星意味着什么吧？姬昌啊，告诉他。”    “这意味着漫长的严寒岁月，冷得能把石头冻成粉末。”周文王长叹一声，说。    “脱水——”纣王又用那歌唱般的声音喊道。其实，在外面的大地上，人们早已开始陆续脱水，重新变成人干以度过漫漫长夜，他们中的幸运者被重新搬入干仓，还有大量的人干被丢弃在旷野上。周文王慢慢站起身，朝架在火上的青铜大鼎走去，他爬上鼎沿，跳进去前停了几秒钟，也许是看到伏羲煮得烂熟的脸正在汤中冲他轻笑。    “用文火。”纣王无力地说，然后转向其他人，“该EXIT的就EXIT吧，游戏到这儿已经没什么玩头了。”3    洞门上方出现了发着红光的EXIT标志，人们纷纷向那里走去。汪淼也跟随而去，穿过洞门和长长的隧道来到了金字塔外，看到黑夜里大雪纷飞，刺骨的寒冷使他打了个冷战。天空的一角显示出游戏的时间又加快了。    十天后，雪仍在下着，但雪片大而厚重，像是凝结的黑暗。有人在汪淼耳边低声说：“这是在下二氧化碳干冰了。”汪淼扭头一看，是周文王的追随者。    又过了十天，雪还在下，但雪花已变得薄而透明，在金字塔洞门透出的火炬的微光中呈现出一种超脱的淡蓝色，像无数飞舞的云母片。    “这雪花已经是凝固的氧、氮了，大气层正在绝对零度中消失。”    金字塔被雪埋了起来，最下层是水的雪，中层是干冰的雪，上层是固态氧、氮的雪。夜空变得异常晴朗，群星像一片银色的火焰。一行字在星空的背景上出现：    这一夜持续了四十八年，第137号文明在严寒中毁灭了，该文明进化至战国层次。    文明的种子仍在，它将重新启动，再次开始在三体世界中命运莫测的进化，欢迎您再次登录。    退出前，汪淼最后注意到的是夜空中的三颗飞星，它们相距很近，相互围绕着，在太空深渊中跳着某种诡异的舞蹈。')

            '汪淼摘下V装具后，发现自己的内衣已被冷汗浸透了，很像是从一场寒冷的噩梦中醒来。他走出纳米中心，下楼开车，按丁仪给的地址去杨冬的母亲家。    乱纪元，乱纪元，乱纪元……    这个概念在汪淼的头脑中萦绕。为什么那个世界的太阳运行会没有规律？一颗恒星的行星，不管其运行轨道是正圆还是偏长的椭圆，其围绕恒星的运动一定是周期性的，全无规律的运行是不可能的……汪淼突然对自己很恼火，他使劲地摇头想赶走头脑中的这一切，不过是个游戏嘛，但他失败了。    乱纪元，乱纪元，乱纪元……    见鬼！别去想它！！为什么非想它不可？为什么？！    很快，汪淼找到了答案。他已经有很多年没有玩过电子游戏了，这些年来电子游戏的软硬件技术显然已经提高了很多，其中的虚拟现实场景和附加效果都是他学生时代所无法比拟的。但汪淼明白，《三体》的真实不在于此。记得在大三的一次信息课中，教授挂出了两幅大图片，一幅是画面庞杂精细的《清明上河图》，另一幅是一张空旷的天空照片，空荡荡的蓝天上只有一缕似有似无的白云。教授问这两幅画中哪一幅所包含的信息量更大，答案是后者要比前者大一至两个数量级！    《三体》正是这样，它的海量信息是隐藏在深处的，汪淼能感觉到，但说不清。他突然悟出，《三体》的不寻常在于，与其他的游戏相比，它的设计者是反其道而行之——一般游戏的设计者都是尽可能地增加显示的信息量，以产生真实感；但《三体》的设计者却是在极力压缩信息量，以隐藏某种巨大的真实，就像那张看似空旷的天空照片。    汪淼放松了思想的缰绳，任其回到《三体》世界。    飞星！关键在于不引人注意的飞星，一颗飞星，二颗飞星，三颗飞星……这分别意味着什么？    正想着，车已开到他要去的小区大门了。    在要去的那栋楼门口，汪淼看到一位六十岁左右的头发花白、身材瘦削的女性，戴着眼镜，提着一个大菜篮子吃力地上楼梯。他猜她大概就是自己要找的人，一问，她果然就是杨冬的母亲，叶文洁。听汪淼说明来意后，她露出发自内心的感动，她是汪淼常见到的那种老知识分子，岁月的风霜已消去了他们性情中所有的刚硬和火热，只剩下如水的柔和。    汪淼拿过菜篮子同她一起上了楼，走进她的家门后发现，这里并不像他想象的那么冷清——有三个孩子在玩耍，最大的不超过五岁，小的刚会走路。杨母告诉汪淼，这都是邻居的孩子。    “他们喜欢在我这儿玩儿，今天是星期天，他们的父母要加班，就把他们丢给我了……哦，楠楠，你的画儿画完了吗？嗯，真好看，起个题目吧！太阳下的小鸭子，好，奶奶给你题上，再写上六月九日，楠楠作……中午你们都想吃什么呢？洋洋？烧茄子？好好；楠楠？昨天吃过的荷兰豆？好好；你呢，咪咪？肉肉？不，你妈妈说了，不要吃那么多肉肉，不好消化的，吃鱼鱼好吗？看奶奶买回来的这么大的鱼鱼……”    她肯定想要孙子或孙女，但即使杨冬活着，会要孩子吗？看着杨母和孩子们投入地对话，汪淼心想。    杨母将篮子提进厨房，出来后对汪淼说：“小汪啊，我先去把菜泡上，现在的蔬菜农药残留很多，给孩子们吃至少要泡两小时以上……你可以先到冬冬的房间里看看。”    杨母最后一句看似无意的提议令汪淼陷入紧张和不安之中，她显然看出了汪淼此行在内心深处的真正目的。她说完就转身回到厨房，没有看汪淼一眼，自然看不到他的窘态，她这几乎天衣无缝的善解人意令汪淼一阵感动。    汪淼转身穿过快乐的孩子们，走向杨母刚才指向的那个房间。他在门前停住了，突然被一种奇异的感觉所淹没，仿佛回到了少年多梦的时节，一些如清晨露珠般晶莹脆弱的感受从记忆的深处中浮起，这里面有最初的伤感和刺痛，但都是玫瑰色的。    汪淼轻轻推开门，扑面而来的淡淡的气息是他没有想到的，那是森林的气息，他仿佛进入了一间护林人的林间小屋。墙壁被一条条棕色的树皮覆盖着，三只凳子是古朴的树桩，写字台也是由三个较大的树桩拼成的，还有那张床，铺的显然是东北的乌拉草。这一切都很粗糙、很随意，没有刻意表现出某种美感。以杨冬的职位，她的收入是很高的，可以在任何一处高档社区买下房子，可她一直同母亲住在这里。    汪淼走到树桩写字台前，上面的陈设很简单，没有与学术有关的东西，也没有与女性有关的东西；也许都已经拿走了，也许从来就没在这里存在过。他首先注意到一张镶在木镜框中的黑白照片，是杨冬母女的合影，照片中的杨冬正值幼年，母亲蹲下正好同她一样高。风很大，将两人的头发吹到一起。照片的背景很奇怪，天空呈网格状，汪淼仔细察看支撑那网络的粗大的钢铁结构，推想那是一个抛物面天线或类似的东西，因为巨大，它的边缘超出了镜头。    照片中，小杨冬的大眼睛中透出一种令汪淼心颤的惶恐，仿佛照片外的世界令她恐惧似的。汪淼注意到的第二件东西是放在写字台一角的一本厚厚的大本子，首先令他迷惑的是本子的材质，他看到封面上有一行稚拙的字：“杨冬的huà（桦）皮本。”这才知道这本子是桦树皮做的，时光已经使银白色的桦皮变成暗黄。他伸手触了一下本子，犹豫了一下又缩了回来。    “你看吧，那是冬冬小时候的画儿。”杨母在门口说。    汪淼捧起桦皮本，轻轻地一页页翻看。每幅画上都有日期，明显是母亲为女儿注上的，就像他刚进门时看到的那样。汪淼又发现了一件多少让他不可理解的事：从画上的日期看，这时的杨冬已经三岁多了，这么大的孩子通常都能够画出比较分明的人或物体的形状；但杨冬的画仍然只是随意纷乱的线条，汪淼从中看出了一种强烈的恼怒和绝望，一种想表达某种东西又无能为力的恼怒和绝望，这种感觉，是这种年龄的普通孩子所不具有的。    杨母缓缓地坐到床沿上，双眼失神地看着汪淼手中的桦皮本，她女儿就是在这里，在安睡中结束了自己的生命。汪淼在杨母身边坐下，他从来没有过如此强烈的愿望，要与他人分担痛苦。    杨母从汪淼手中拿过桦皮本，抱在胸前，轻声说：“我对冬冬的教育有些不知深浅，让她太早接触了那些太抽象、太终极的东西。当她第一次表现出对那些抽象理论的兴趣时，我告诉她，那个世界，女人是很难进入的。她说居里夫人不是进入了吗？我告诉她，居里夫人根本没有进入，她的成功只是源于勤奋和执著，没有她，那些工作别人也会完成，倒是像吴健雄[3]这样的女人还比她走得远些，但那真的不是女人的世界。女性的思维方式不同于男性，这没有高下之分，对世界来说都是必不可少的。”    “冬冬没有反驳我。到后来，我真的发现她身上有一些特殊的东西，比如给她讲一个公式，别的孩子会说‘这公式真巧妙’之类的，她则会说这公式真好看、真漂亮，那神情就像她看到一朵漂亮的野花一样。她父亲留下了一堆唱片，她听来听去，最后选择了一张巴赫的反复听，那是最不可能令孩子，特别是女孩子入迷的音乐了。开始我以为她是随意为之，但问她感受时，这孩子说：她看到一个巨人在大地上搭一座好大好复杂的房子，巨人一点一点地搭着，乐曲完了，大房子也就搭完了……”    “您对女儿的教育真是成功。”汪淼感慨地说。    “不，是失败啊！她的世界太单纯，只有那些空灵的理论。那些东西一崩溃，就没有什么能支撑她活下去了。”    “叶老师，您这么想我觉得也不对，现在发生了一些让我们难以想象的事，这是一次空前的理论灾难，做出这种选择的科学家又不只是她一人。”    “可只有她一个女人，女人应该像水一样的，什么样的地方都能淌得过去啊。”    ……    告辞时，汪淼才想到了来访的另一个目的，于是他向杨母说起了观测宇宙背景辐射的事。    “哦，这个，国内有两个地方正在做，一个在乌鲁木齐观测基地，好像是中科院空间环境观测中心的项目；另一个很近，就在北京近郊的射电天文观测基地，是中科院和北大那个联合天体物理中心搞的。前面那个是实际地面观察，北京这个只是接收卫星数据，不过数据更准确、全面一些。那里有我的一个学生，我帮你联系一下吧。”杨母说着，去找电话号码，然后给那个学生打电话，似乎很顺利。    “没问题的，我给你个地址，你直接去就行。他叫沙瑞山，明天正好值夜班……你好像不是搞这专业的吧？”杨母放下电话问。    “我搞纳米，我这是为了……另外一些事情。”汪淼很怕杨母追问下去，但她没有。    “小汪啊，你脸色怎么这么不好？好像身体很虚的。”杨母关切地问。    “没什么，就是这样儿。”汪淼含糊地说。    “你等等，”杨母从柜子里拿出一个小木盒，汪淼看到上面标明是人参，“过去在基地的一位老战士前两天来看我，带来这个……不，不，你拿去，人工种植的，不是什么珍贵的东西，我血压高，根本用不着的。你可以切成薄片泡茶喝，我看你脸色，好像血很亏的样子。年轻人，一定要爱护自己啊。”    汪淼的心中涌起一股暖流，双眼湿润了，他那颗两天来绷得紧紧的心脏像被放到了柔软的天鹅绒上。“叶老师，我会常来看您的。”他接过木盒说。')

            '汪淼驱车沿京密路到密云县，再转至黑龙潭，又走了一段盘山路，便到达中科院国家天文观测中心的射电天文观测基地。他看到二十八面直径为九米的抛物面天线在暮色中一字排开，像一排壮观的钢铁植物，2006年建成的两台高大的五十米口径射电望远镜天线矗立在这排九米天线的尽头，车驶近后，它们令汪淼不由想起了那张杨冬母女合影的背景。    但叶文洁的学生从事的项目与这些射电望远镜没有什么关系，沙瑞山博士的实验室主要接收三颗卫星的观测数据：1989年11月升空、即将淘汰的微波背景探测卫星COBE，2001年发射的威尔金森微波各向异性探测卫星WMAP和2009年欧洲航天局发射的普朗克高精度宇宙微波背景探测卫星Planck。    宇宙整体的微波背景辐射频谱非常精确地符合温度为2.726K的黑体辐射谱，具有高度各向同性，但在不同局部也存在大约百万分之五涨落的幅度。沙瑞山的工作就是根据卫星观测数据，重新绘制一幅更精确的全宇宙微波辐射背景图。这个实验室不大，主机房中挤满了卫星数据接收设备，有三台终端分别显示来自三颗卫星的数据。    沙瑞山见到汪淼，立刻表现出了那种长期在寂寞之地工作的人见到来客的热情，问他想了解哪方面的观测数据。    “我想观测宇宙背景辐射的整体波动。”    “您能……说具体些吗？”沙瑞山看汪淼的眼神变得奇怪起来。    “就是，宇宙3K微波背景辐射整体上的各向同性的波动，振幅在百分之一至百分之五之间。”    沙瑞山笑笑，早在本世纪初，密云射电天文基地就对游客开放参观，为挣些外快，沙瑞山时常做些导游或讲座的事，这种笑容就是他回答游客（他已适应了那些骇人的科盲）问题时常常露出的。“汪先生，您……不是搞这个专业的吧？”1    “我搞纳米材料。”    “哦，那就对了。不过，对于宇宙3K背景辐射，您大概有个了解吧？”    “知道的不多。目前的宇宙起源理论认为，宇宙诞生于距今约一百四十亿年前的一次大爆炸。在诞生早期，宇宙温度极高，随后开始冷却，形成被称为微波背景辐射的‘余烬’。这种弥漫全宇宙的残留背景辐射，在厘米波段上是可以观测到的。好像是在一九六几年吧，两个美国人在调试一个高精度卫星接收天线时意外地发现了宇宙背景辐射……”    “足够了，”沙瑞山挥手打断了汪淼的话，“那你就应该知道，与我们观测的不同部分的微小不均匀不同，宇宙整体辐射背景波动是随着宇宙的膨胀，在宇宙时间尺度上缓慢变化的，以Planck卫星的精度，直到一百万年后都未必能测出这种变化，你却想在今天晚上发现它百分之五的波动？！知道这意味着什么吗？这意味着整个宇宙像一个坏了的日光灯管那样闪烁！”    而且是为我闪烁，汪淼心里说。    “叶老师这是在开什么玩笑。”沙瑞山摇摇头说。    “但愿真是个玩笑。”汪淼说，本想告诉他，叶文洁并不知道详情，但又怕因此招致他的拒绝，不过这倒是他的心里话。    “既然是叶老师交代的，就观测吧，反正也不费劲，百分之一的精度，用老古董COBE就行了。”沙瑞山说着，在终端上忙活起来，很快屏幕上出现一条平直的绿线，“你看，这就是当前宇宙整体背景辐射的实时数值曲线，哦，应该叫直线才对，数值是2.726±0.010K，那个误差是银河系运动产生的多普勒效应，已经滤掉了。如果发生你所说的超过百分之一振幅的波动，这条线就会变红并将波动显示出来。我敢打赌直到世界末日它也是条绿直线，要看到它显现肉眼看得到的变化，可能比看太阳毁灭还要等更长的时间。”    “这不会影响您的正常工作吧？”    “当然不会，那么粗的精度，用COBE观察数据的边角料就足够了。好了，从现在开始，如果那伟大的波动出现，数值会自动存盘。”    “可能要等到凌晨一点。”    “哇，这么精确？没关系，反正我本来就是值夜班。您吃饭了吗？那好，我带您去参观一下吧。”    这一夜没有月亮，他们沿着长长的天线阵列漫步。沙瑞山指着天线说：“壮观吧？可惜都是聋子的耳朵。”    “为什么？”    “自它们建成以来，在观测频段上就干扰不断，先是上世纪八十年代末的寻呼台，到现在是疯狂发展的移动通信。这些米波综合孔径射电望远镜能做的那些项目，像米波巡天、射电变源、超新星遗迹研究等等，大部分都不能正常开展。多次找过无委会（国家无线电管理委员会），没有用，我们能玩得过中国移动、联通、网通？没有钱，宇宙奥秘算个球！好在我的项目靠卫星数据，与这些‘旅游景观’无关了。”    “近年来很多基础研究的商业运行还是很成功的，比如高能物理。把观测基地建到离城市远些的地方应该好些吧？”    “那还是钱的问题。就目前而言，只能是在技术上屏蔽干扰。唉，叶老师要在就好了，她在这方面造诣很深。”    然后，他们来到一家为游客开的通宵酒吧。沙瑞山一杯接着一杯地灌啤酒，变得更加健谈。话题集中在叶文洁身上。从她的学生这里，汪淼得知了她那历经风霜的前半生。')

            '中国，1967年。    “红色联合”对“四·二八兵团”总部大楼的攻击已持续了两天，他们的旗帜在大楼周围躁动地飘扬着，仿佛渴望干柴的火种。“红色联合”的指挥官心急如焚，他并不惧怕大楼的守卫者，那二百多名“四·二八”战士，与诞生于1966年初、经历过大检阅和大串联的“红色联合”相比要稚嫩许多。他怕的是大楼中那十几个大铁炉子，里面塞满了烈性炸药，用电雷管串联起来，他看不到它们，但能感觉到它们磁石般的存在，开关一合，玉石俱焚，而“四·二八”的那些小红卫兵们是有这个精神力量的。比起已经在风雨中成熟了许多的第一代红卫兵，新生的造反派们像火炭上的狼群，除了疯狂还是疯狂。1    大楼顶上出现了一个娇小的身影，那个美丽的女孩子挥动着一面“四·二八”的大旗，她的出现立刻招来了一阵杂乱的枪声，射击的武器五花八门，有陈旧的美式卡宾枪、捷克式机枪和三八大盖，也有崭新的制式步枪和冲锋枪——后者是在“八月社论”发表之后从军队中偷抢来的——连同那些梭镖和大刀等冷兵器，构成了一部浓缩的近现代史……“四·二八”的人在前面多次玩过这个游戏，在楼顶上站出来的人，除了挥舞旗帜外，有时还用喇叭筒喊口号或向下撒传单，每次他们都能在弹雨中全身而退，为自己挣到崇高的荣誉。这次出来的女孩儿显然也相信自己还有那样的幸运。她挥舞着战旗，挥动着自己燃烧的青春，敌人将在这火焰中化为灰烬，理想世界明天就会在她那沸腾的热血中诞生……她陶醉在这鲜红灿烂的梦幻中，直到被一颗步枪子弹洞穿了胸膛，十五岁少女的胸膛是那么柔嫩，那颗子弹穿过后基本上没有减速，在她身后的空中发出一声啾鸣。年轻的红卫兵同她的旗帜一起从楼顶落下，她那轻盈的身体落得甚至比旗帜还慢，仿佛小鸟眷恋着天空。其实，比起另外一些人来，她还是幸运的，至少是在为理想献身的壮丽激情中死去。    这样的热点遍布整座城市，像无数并行运算的CPU，将“文化大革命”联为一个整体。疯狂如同无形的洪水，将城市淹没其中，并渗透到每一个细微的角落和缝隙。    在城市边缘的那所著名大学的操场上，一场几千人参加的批斗会已经进行了近两个小时。在这个派别林立的年代，任何一处都有错综复杂的对立派别在格斗。在校园中，红卫兵、文革工作组、工宣队和军宣队，相互之间都在爆发尖锐的冲突，而每种派别的内部又时时分化出新的对立派系，捍卫着各自不同的背景和纲领，爆发更为残酷的较量。但这次被批斗的反动学术权威，却是任何一方均无异议的斗争目标，他们也只能同时承受来自各方的残酷打击。    与其他牛鬼蛇神相比，反动学术权威有他们的特点：当打击最初到来时，他们的表现往往是高傲而顽固的，这也是他们伤亡率最高的阶段；他们有的因不认罪而被活活打死，有的则选择了用自杀的方式来维护自己的尊严。    从这一阶段幸存下来的人，在持续的残酷打击下渐渐麻木，这是一种自我保护的精神外壳，使他们避免最后的崩溃。他们在批斗会上常常进入半睡眠状态，只有一声恫吓才能使其惊醒过来，机械地重复那已说过无数遍的认罪词；然后，他们中的一部分人便进入了第三阶段，旷日持久的批判将鲜明的政治图像如水银般注入了他们的意识，将他们那由知识和理性构筑的思想大厦彻底摧毁，他们真的相信自己有罪，真的看到了自己对伟大事业构成的损害，并为此痛哭流涕，他们的忏悔往往比那些非知识分子的牛鬼蛇神要深刻得多，也真诚得多。而对于红卫兵来说，进入后两个阶段的批判对象是最乏味的，只有处于第一阶段的牛鬼蛇神才能对他们那早已过度兴奋的神经产生有效的刺激，如同斗牛士手上的红布，但这样的对象越来越少了，在这所大学中可能只剩下一个，他由于自己的珍稀而被留到批判大会最后出场。    叶哲泰从文革开始一直活到了现在，并且一直处于第一阶段，他不认罪，不自杀，也不麻木。当这位物理学教授走上批判台时，他那神情分明在说：让我背负的十字架更沉重一些吧！    红卫兵们让他负担的东西确实很重，但不是十字架。别的批判对象戴的高帽子都是用竹条扎的框架，而他戴的这顶却是用一指粗的钢筋焊成的，还有他挂在胸前的那块牌子，也不是别人挂的木板，而是从实验室的一个烤箱上拆下的铁门，上面用黑色醒目地写着他的名字，并沿对角线画上了一个红色的大叉。    押送叶哲泰上台的红卫兵比别的批判对象多了一倍，有六人，两男四女。两个男青年步伐稳健有力，一副成熟的青年布尔什维克形象，他们都是物理系理论物理专业大四年级的，叶哲泰曾是他们的老师；那四名女孩子要年轻得多，都是大学附中的初二学生，这些穿着军装扎着武装带的小战士挟带着逼人的青春活力，像四团绿色的火焰包围着叶哲泰。叶哲泰的出现使下面的人群兴奋起来，刚才已有些乏力的口号声又像新一轮海潮般重新高昂起来，淹没了一切。    耐心地等口号声平息下去后，台上两名男红卫兵中的一人转向批判对象：“叶哲泰，你精通各种力学，应该看到自己正在抗拒的这股伟大的合力是多么强大，顽固下去是死路一条！今天继续上次大会的议程，废话就不多说了。老实回答下面的问题：在六二至六五届的基础课中，你是不是擅自加入了大量的相对论内容？！”    “相对论已经成为物理学的古典理论，基础课怎么能不涉及它呢？”叶哲泰回答说。    “你胡说！”旁边的一名女红卫兵厉声说，“爱因斯坦是反动的学术权威，他有奶便是娘，跑去为美帝国主义造原子弹！要建立起革命的科学，就要打倒以相对论为代表的资产阶级理论黑旗！”    叶哲泰沉默着，他在忍受着头上铁高帽和胸前铁板带来的痛苦，不值得回应的问题就沉默了。在他身后，他的学生也微微皱了一下眉头。说话的女孩儿是这四个中学红卫兵中天资最聪颖的一个，并且显然有备而来，刚才上台前还看到她在背批判稿，但要对付叶哲泰，仅凭她那几句口号是不行的。他们决定亮出今天为老师准备的新武器，其中的一人对台下挥了一下手。    叶哲泰的妻子，同系的物理学教授绍琳从台下的前排站起来，走上台。她身穿一件很不合体的草绿色衣服，显然想与红卫兵的色彩拉近距离，但熟悉绍琳的人联想到以前常穿精致旗袍讲课的她，总觉得别扭。    “叶哲泰！”绍琳指着丈夫喝道，她显然不习惯于这种场合，尽量拔高自己的声音，却连其中的颤抖也放大了，“你没有想到我会站出来揭发你，批判你吧！？是的，我以前受你欺骗，你用自己那反动的世界观和科学观蒙蔽了我！现在我醒悟了，在革命小将的帮助下，我要站到革命的一边，人民的一边！”她转向台下，“同志们、革命小将们、革命的教职员工们，我们应该认清爱因斯坦相对论的反动本质，这种本质，广义相对论体现得最清楚：它提出的静态宇宙模型，否定了物质的运动本性，是反辩证法的！它认为宇宙有限，更是彻头彻尾的反动唯心主义……”    听着妻子滔滔不绝的演讲，叶哲泰苦笑了一下。琳，我蒙蔽了你？其实你在我心中倒一直是个谜。    一次，我对你父亲称赞你那过人的天资——他很幸运，去得早，躲过了这场灾难——老人家摇摇头，说我女儿不可能在学术上有什么建树；接着，他说出了对我后半生很重要的一句话：琳琳太聪明了，可是搞基础理论，不笨不行啊。    以后的许多年里，我不断悟出这话的深意。琳，你真的太聪明了，早在几年前，你就嗅出了知识界的政治风向，做出了一些超前的举动，比如你在教学中，把大部分物理定律和参数都改了名字，欧姆定律改叫电阻定律，麦克斯韦方程改名成电磁方程，普朗克常数叫成了量子常数……你对学生们解释说：所有的科学成果都是广大劳动人民智慧的结晶，那些资产阶级学术权威不过是窃取了这些智慧。但即使这样，你仍然没有被“革命主流”所接纳，看看现在的你，衣袖上没有“革命教职员工”都戴着的红袖章；你两手空空地上来，连一本语录都没资格拿……谁让你出生在旧中国那样一个显赫的家庭，你父母又都是那么著名的学者。    说起爱因斯坦，你比我有更多的东西需要交代。1922年冬天，爱因斯坦到上海访问，你父亲因德语很好被安排为接待陪同者之一。你多次告诉我，父亲是在爱因斯坦的亲自教诲下走上物理学之路的，而你选择物理专业又是受了父亲的影响，所以爱翁也可以看作你的间接导师，你为此感到无比的自豪和幸福。    后来我知道，父亲对你讲了善意的谎言，他与爱因斯坦只有过一次短得不能再短的交流。    那是1922年11月13日上午，他陪爱因斯坦到南京路散步，同行的好像还有上海大学校长于右任、《大公报》经理曹谷冰等人，经过一个路基维修点，爱因斯坦在一名砸石子的小工身旁停下，默默看着这个在寒风中衣衫破烂、手脸污黑的男孩子，问你父亲：他一天挣多少钱？问过小工后，你父亲回答：五分。这就是他与改变世界的科学大师唯一的一次交流，没有物理学，没有相对论，只有冰冷的现实。据你父亲说，爱因斯坦听到他的回答后又默默地站在那里好一会儿，看着小工麻木的劳作，手里的烟斗都灭了也没有吸一口。你父亲在回忆这件事后，对我发出这样的感叹：在中国，任何超脱飞扬的思想都会砰然坠地的，现实的引力太沉重了。    “低下头！”一名男红卫兵大声命令。这也许是自己的学生对老师一丝残存的同情，被批斗者都要低头，但叶哲泰要这样，那顶沉重的铁高帽就会掉下去，以后只要他一直低着头，就没有理由再给他戴上。但叶哲泰仍昂着头，用瘦弱的脖颈支撑着那束沉重的钢铁。    “低头！你个反动顽固分子！！”旁边一名女红卫兵解下腰间的皮带朝叶哲泰挥去，黄铜带扣正打在他脑门上，在那里精确地留下了带扣的形状，但很快又被淤血模糊成黑紫的一团。他摇晃了一下，又站稳了。    一名男红卫兵质问叶哲泰：“在量子力学的教学中，你也散布过大量的反动言论！”说完对绍琳点点头，示意她继续。    绍琳迫不及待地要继续下去了，她必须不停顿地说下去，以维持自己那摇摇欲坠的精神免于彻底垮掉。“叶哲泰，这一点你是无法抵赖的！你多次向学生散布反动的哥本哈根解释！”    “这毕竟是目前公认的最符合实验结果的解释。”叶哲泰说，在受到如此重击后，他的口气还如此从容，这让绍琳很吃惊，也很恐惧。    “这个解释认为，是外部的观察导致了量子波函数的坍缩，这是反动唯心论的另一种表现形式，而且是一种最猖狂的表现！”    “是哲学指引实验还是实验指引哲学？”叶哲泰问道，他这突然的反击令批判者们一时不知所措。    “当然是正确的马克思主义哲学指引科学实验！”一名男红卫兵说。    “这等于说正确的哲学是从天上掉下来的。反对实践出真知，恰恰是违背马克思主义对自然界的认知原则的。”    绍琳和两名大学红卫兵无言以对，与中学和社会上的红卫兵不同，他们不可能一点儿道理也不讲。但来自附中的四位小将自有她们“无坚不摧”的革命方式，刚才动手的那个女孩儿又狠抽了叶哲泰一皮带，另外三个女孩子也都分别抡起皮带抽了一下，当同伴革命时，她们必须表现得更革命，至少要同样革命。两名男红卫兵没有过问，他们要是现在管这事，也有不革命的嫌疑。    “你还在教学中散布宇宙大爆炸理论，这是所有科学理论中最反动的一个！”一名男红卫兵试图转移话题。    “也许以后这个理论会被推翻，但本世纪的两大宇宙学发现：哈勃红移和3K宇宙背景辐射，使大爆炸学说成为目前为止最可信的宇宙起源理论。”    “胡说！”绍琳大叫起来，又接着滔滔不绝地讲起了宇宙大爆炸，自然不忘深刻地剖析其反动本质。但这理论的超级新奇吸引了四个小女孩儿中最聪明的那一个，她不由自主地问道：    “连时间都是从那个奇点开始的！？那奇点以前有什么？”    “什么都没有。”叶哲泰说，像回答任何一个小女孩儿的问题那样，他转头慈祥地看着她，铁高帽和已受的重伤，使他这动作很艰难。    “什么……都没有？！反动！反动透顶！！”那女孩儿惊恐万状地大叫起来，她不知所措地转向绍琳寻求帮助，立刻得到了回应。    “这给上帝的存在留下了位置。”绍琳对女孩儿点点头提示说。    小红卫兵那茫然的思路立刻找到了立脚点，她举起紧握皮带的手指着叶哲泰，“你，是想说有上帝？！”    “我不知道。”    “你说什么！”    “我是说不知道，如果上帝是指宇宙之外的超意识的话，我不知道它是不是存在；正反两方面，科学都没给出确实的证据。”其实，在这噩梦般的时刻，叶哲泰已倾向于相信它不存在了。    这句大逆不道的话在整个会场引起了骚动，在台上一名红卫兵的带领下，又爆发了一波波的口号声。    “打倒反动学术权威叶哲泰！！”    “打倒一切反动学术权威！！”    “打倒一切反动学说！！”    ……    “上帝是不存在的，一切宗教，都是统治阶级编造出来的麻痹人民的精神工具！”口号平息后，那个小女孩儿大声说。    “这种看法是片面的。”叶哲泰平静地说。    恼羞成怒的小红卫兵立刻做出了判断，对于眼前这个危险的敌人，一切语言都无意义了。她抡起皮带冲上去，她的三个小同志立刻跟上，叶哲泰的个子很高，这四个十四岁的女孩儿只能朝上抡皮带才能打到他那不肯低下的头，在开始的几下打击后，他头上能起一定保护作用的铁高帽被打掉了，接下来带铜扣的宽皮带如雨点般打在他的头上和身上——他终于倒下了，这鼓舞了小红卫兵们，她们更加投入地继续着这“崇高”的战斗，她们在为信念而战，为理想而战，她们为历史给予自己的光辉使命所陶醉，为自己的英勇而自豪……    “最高指示：要文斗不要武斗！”叶哲泰的两名学生终于下定了决心，喊出了这句话，两人同时冲过去，拉开了已处于半疯狂状态的四个小女孩儿。    但已经晚了，物理学家静静地躺在地上，半睁的双眼看着从他的头颅上流出的血迹，疯狂的会场瞬间陷入了一片死寂，那条血迹是唯一在动的东西，它像一条红蛇缓慢地蜿蜒爬行着，到达台沿后一滴滴地滴在下面一个空箱子上，发出有节奏的“嗒嗒”声，像渐行渐远的脚步。    一阵怪笑声打破了寂静，这声音是精神已彻底崩溃的绍琳发出的，听起来十分恐怖。人们开始离去，最后发展成一场大溃逃，每个人都想尽快逃离这个地方。会场很快空了下来，只剩下一个姑娘站在台下。    她是叶哲泰的女儿叶文洁。    当那四个女孩儿施暴夺去父亲生命时，她曾想冲上台去，但身边的两名老校工死死抓住她，并在耳边低声告诉她别连自己的命也不要了，当时会场已经处于彻底的癫狂，她的出现只会引出更多的暴徒。她曾声嘶力竭地哭叫，但声音淹没在会场上疯狂的口号和助威声中，当一切寂静下来时，她自己也发不出任何声音了，只是凝视着台上父亲已没有生命的躯体，那没有哭出和喊出的东西在她的血液中弥漫、溶解，将伴她一生。    人群散去后，她站在那里，身体和四肢仍保持着老校工抓着她时的姿态，一动不动，像石化了一般。过了好久，她才将悬空的手臂放下来，缓缓起身走上台，坐在父亲的遗体边，握起他的一只已凉下来的手，两眼失神地看着远方。当遗体要被抬走时，叶文洁从衣袋中拿出一样东西放到父亲的那只手中，那是父亲的烟斗。    文洁默默地离开了已经空无一人一片狼藉的操场，走上回家的路。当她走到教工宿舍楼下时，听到了从二楼自家窗口传出的一阵阵痴笑声，这声音是那个她曾叫做妈妈的女人发出的。文洁默默地转身走去，任双脚将她带向别处。')

            '''Wang Miao felt that the four people who came to him were a strange combination: two policemen and two soldiers. It would be normal if the two soldiers were armed police, but these were two army officers. Wang Miao did not like the policeman who came to him at first glance. Actually the young man in the police uniform was okay and behaved very politely, but the plainclothes man was annoying. This man was tall and thick, with a fleshy face, wearing a dirty leather jacket, smelled like cigarettes, and spoke in a rough voice. He was the type of person that Wang Miao disliked the most. "Wang Miao?" the man asked. Calling him by his first name made Wang Miao very uncomfortable. Moreover, the man was still lighting a cigarette at the same time without raising his head. Before Wang Miao could answer, he motioned to the young man next to him. The latter showed Wang Miao his police officer's card, and after he finished lighting his cigarette, he went straight into the house. "Please don't smoke in my house." Wang Miao stopped him. "Oh, I'm sorry, Professor Wang. This is our Captain Shi Qiang." The young police officer said with a smile, and at the same time winked at Shi. "Success, then let's talk in the corridor." Shi Qiang said, taking a deep breath, the cigarette in his hand was almost half burnt, and he didn't see any smoke after that. "You ask." He turned his head again to the young police officer. "Professor Wang, we want to know. Recently, you have had contact with members of the 'Science Frontiers' society, right?" "'Science Frontiers' is an academic organization with great influence in the international academic community. Scholars. Why can’t I contact such a legitimate academic organization?” “Look at you!” Shi Qiang said loudly, “Did we say it’s illegal? Did we say we won’t allow you to contact it? As he spoke, all the smoke he inhaled just now sprayed on Wang Miao's face. "Well, this is personal privacy. I don't need to answer your questions." "It's all private. A famous scholar like you should be responsible for public safety." Shi Qiang threw away the cigarette butt in his hand , and pulled out another cigarette from the flattened cigarette case. "I have the right not to answer, please go ahead." Wang Miao said and turned to go back to the room. "Wait!" Shi Qiang said sharply, and at the same time waved his hand at the young police officer next to him, "Give him the address and phone number, and go for a walk in the afternoon." "What are you going to do!" Wang Miao asked angrily. Neighbors poked their heads out, too, to see what was going on. "Team Shi! You say you—" The young police officer pulled Shi Qiang aside angrily. Obviously, Wang Miao was not the only one who was uncomfortable with his vulgarity. 1 "Professor Wang, please don't get me wrong." A major officer hurried forward, "There is an important meeting in the afternoon, and several scholars and experts will be invited to attend. The chief asked us to invite you." "I'm very busy this afternoon." " We know this, the chief has already greeted the leaders of the Superconducting Center. This meeting cannot be without you, if it is impossible, we have to postpone the meeting to wait for you.” Shi Qiang and his colleagues did not speak anymore, turned and went downstairs , the two officers watched them walk away, and seemed to let out a sigh of relief. "Why is this man like this?" the major whispered to his colleagues. "He has a lot of bad deeds. In a hostage-taking incident a few years ago, he acted without regard to the life and death of the hostages. As a result, a family of three died at the hands of criminals; Last year, they conducted torture to extract a confession and disabled a suspect, so he was suspended..." "How can such a person enter the combat center?" , the restrictions on him are very strict, except for public security affairs, he is almost not allowed to know anything.” 1 Combat Center? what is that? Wang Miao looked at the two officers in front of him in puzzlement. The car that picked up Wang Miao drove into a compound in the outskirts of the city. From the gate with only the house number but no unit name plate, Wang Miao knew that this was the territory of the military, not the police. The meeting was held in a hall, and Wang Miao was quite surprised by the chaos as soon as he entered. Around the hall is a circle of randomly placed computer equipment. Some tables are placed on the floor if they cannot fit on the table. Wires and network cables are entangled and scattered on the ground; a large stack of network switches is not installed in the rack, but piled up on the server. ; There are several large screens of projectors standing randomly at different angles in the corner of the hall, like a gypsy tent; the smoke floats in mid-air like morning fog... Wang Miao wonders if this is the one The combat center mentioned by a military officer, he can be sure of one thing: the things being dealt with here have already made people forget about other things. The impromptu meeting table was also full of documents and sundries. Most of the participants looked tired, their clothes were wrinkled, and those with ties were torn apart, as if they had stayed up all night. The meeting was chaired by a major general named Chang Weisi, and half of the participants were soldiers. After a brief introduction, he knew that there were still a small number of police officers, and the others were experts and scholars who attended the meeting like him, and some of them were well-known scientists who studied basic science. What surprised him was that there were four foreigners whose identities surprised him: two of them were also soldiers, namely a colonel in the U.S. Air Force and a colonel in the British Army, and their positions were NATO liaison officers; A CIA officer, what is the role of an observer here. 1 From everyone's faces, Wang Miao read a sentence: We have tried our best, let's fucking end it! When Wang Miao saw Shi Qiang, he greeted Wang Miao contrary to yesterday's rudeness, but that silly smile made Wang Miao unhappy. He didn't want to sit next to Shi Qiang, but there was only one vacant seat, so he had no choice but to sit there. The already strong smell of cigarettes in the room became even heavier. 1 When distributing the documents, Shi Qiang approached Wang Miao and said, "Professor Wang, you seem to be researching... new materials?" "Nanomaterials." Wang Miao replied simply. "I've heard that it's very powerful, so it won't be used for crimes, right?" From Shi Qiang's half-joking expression, Wang Miao couldn't tell if he was joking. "What do you mean?" "Heh, I heard that that thing is as thick as a hair can lift a large truck, and if criminals steal some to make a knife, that knife can cut a car in half Right." "Hmph, you don't need to make a knife at all, use that kind of material to make a thread that is only one percent as thick as a human hair, and if you stop it on the road, you can cut the passing cars in half like cutting cheese... What can't be used for crimes? A knife for scraping fish scales can do it!" 2 Shi Qiang took half of the documents in front of him out of his pocket and stuffed them back, apparently losing interest. "You're right, fish can commit crimes! I did a murder case where a bitch cut off her husband's. Know what? Tilapia from the freezer! The fish was frozen hard Finally, the row of thorns on the back is like a sharp knife..." 1 "I'm not interested, why, this is what I came to the meeting for?" "Fish? Nanomaterials? No, no, nothing like those It's okay." Shi Qiang put his mouth next to Wang Miao's ear, "Don't give these guys a good face, they discriminate against us, they only want to get information from us, but they don't tell us anything. For many months, I still don’t know anything like you.” “Comrades, the meeting begins.” General Chang Weisi said, “In all theaters around the world, our place is now the focus. First, let’s introduce the current situation to the comrades attending the meeting. The unusual term "war zone" confused Wang Miao, and he also noticed that the chief didn't seem to intend to introduce the ins and outs to a newcomer like him, which confirmed Shi Qiang's words. In General Chang's short opening remarks, he mentioned "comrades" twice. Wang Miao looked at the two NATO soldiers and two CIA officials opposite him, and felt that the general seemed to have missed "gentlemen". "They are also comrades, that's what people here call them anyway." Shi Qiang said to Wang Miao in a low voice, and at the same time pointed at the four foreigners with a cigarette in his hand. While being puzzled, Wang Miao was impressed by Shi Qiang's observation ability. "Da Shi, put out the cigarette, the smell of smoke here is strong enough." Chang Weisi said, looking down at the documents. Shi Qiang took the cigarette he had just lit and looked around. He couldn't find the ashtray, so he threw it into the teacup with a "squeak". He seized this opportunity to raise his hand to ask for a speech, and before Chang Weisi could make a statement, he said loudly: "Chief, I have a request, as I mentioned before - the information is equal!" General Chang Weisi raised his head, "There is no one Military operations are equal in information, and experts and scholars attending the meeting would like to ask for your understanding that we cannot give you more background information.” “But we are different.” Shi Qiang said, “The police were established from the combat center. We have been involved since the beginning, but until now, we don’t even know what this agency does. Moreover, you are pushing the police out, you are getting familiar with our work step by step, and then driving us away one by one.” Several other police officers stopped Shi Qiang in low voices. Wang Miao was a little surprised that Shi Qiang dared to say such a thing to a chief at Chang Weisi's level, and the latter's counterattack was even sharper. "I'm talking about Da Shi. Now it seems that your old problems in the army have not changed. Can you represent the police? You have been suspended for several months because of your bad behavior, and you will soon be cleared from the police force. I transferred you because I value your experience in urban policing, and you should cherish this opportunity." Da Shi said in a rough voice, "Then I have committed a crime and made meritorious service? Don't you say that it is all crooked experience? ""But it's useful." Chang Weisi nodded to Shi Qiang. In Mandarin, "We can no longer use conventional thinking." The British colonel obviously understood Chinese, he nodded, "To be or not to be..." 2 "What did he say?" Shi Qiang asked Wang Miao . "Nothing." Wang Miao replied mechanically. These people seem to be talking in their dreams, during the war? Where is the war? He turned his head to look at the floor-to-ceiling windows in the hall, through which he could see the city outside the compound in the distance: under the spring sunshine, the streets were full of traffic; there were people walking their dogs on the lawn, and a few children were playing... Inside Which is more real, or the outside world? General Chang said: "Recently, the enemy's attacks have obviously intensified, and the target is still high-level scientific circles. Please read the list in the document first." The list was printed in a large number, and the list was obviously drafted hastily, with both Chinese and English names. "Professor Wang, what impression do you have when you see this list?" Chang Weisi looked at Wang Miao and asked. "I know three of them are well-known scholars at the forefront of physics." Wang Miao replied, a little absent-minded, his eyes locked on the last name. The above lines are different. How can I see her name here? What's up with her? "Know?" Da Shi asked, pointing at the name on the document with a thick smoky yellow finger. Seeing that Wang Miao didn't respond, he reacted quickly and said, "Oh, I don't know you well. Want to know?" Now, Wang Miao knew that it was reasonable for Chang Weisi to transfer his former soldier, this vulgar-looking guy , the eyes are like knives. He may not be a good cop, but he is a tough one. That was a year ago, and Wang Miao was in charge of the nano-component part of the "Zhonghua-2" high-energy accelerator project. That afternoon on the construction site in Liangxiang, during a short break, he was suddenly attracted by a composition in front of him. As a landscape photographer, realistic scenes often form artistic compositions in his eyes. The main body of the composition is the superconducting coil they are installing. The coil is three stories high and halfway through the installation. It looks like a monster composed of a huge metal block and a mess of ultra-low temperature refrigerant pipes, like a pile of giants from the industrial era. The rubbish shows an inhuman technological coldness and steely brutality. Just in front of the metal monster, a slender figure of a young woman appeared. The distribution of light in this composition is also excellent: the metal giant is submerged in the shadow of the temporary construction roof, revealing the cold and rough texture; and a beam of golden light from the setting sun, through the hole in the roof, just casts on the figure , the soft warm light shone on her smooth hair, and shone on the fair neck on the neckline of the overalls. It looked like a delicate flower bloomed on the huge metal ruins after a violent thunderstorm... 3 "Look Look, work!" Wang Miao was taken aback, and then found that the director of the Nano Research Center was not talking about him, but a young engineer, who was also staring blankly at the figure like himself. Wang Miao came back to reality from art, and found that the woman was not an ordinary worker, because the chief engineer was accompanying her, introducing something to her, with a very respectful look. "Who is she?" Wang Miao asked the director. "You should know her," said the director, drawing a large circle with his hand, "after the completion of this accelerator with an investment of 20 billion, the first operation may be to verify a superstring model she proposed. In the theoretical research circle, it was not her turn, but those old guys didn't dare to come first, for fear of embarrassment, so they let her take advantage of it." "What? Yang Dong is...a woman?!" "Yes, We only found out when we saw her the day before yesterday." The director said. The engineer asked: "Does she have some psychological barriers, or why has she never appeared in the media? Don't be like Qian Zhongshu, everyone didn't watch it on TV until death." But it’s not like we don’t know Qian Zhongshu’s gender, right? I think she must have had some unusual experiences in her childhood, which led to her getting autism.” Wang Miao said, feeling somewhat sour grapes. Yang Dong and the chief engineer came over, she smiled and nodded to them as they passed by, without saying a word, but Wang Miao remembered her clear eyes. That night, Wang Miao was sitting in his study room, admiring some of his favorite landscape photos hanging on the wall. His eyes fell on a scene beyond the Great Wall—a desolate valley with snow-capped mountains emerging from the end of the valley. A touch of whiteness; at this end of the valley, half of the vicissitudes of dead wood occupy almost one-third of the picture. In Wang Miao's imagination, he overprinted the figure that lingered in his mind onto the picture, making her look very small in the depths of the valley; at this moment, Wang Miao was surprised to find that the whole picture came to life, as if in the photo. Her world recognized that figure, as if all this existed for her. In turn, he superimposed that figure on several other works in his imagination, and sometimes used her eyes as the background of the empty sky in the photos. beautiful. In the past, Wang Miao always felt that his photographs lacked some kind of soul; now he knows that what is missing is her. "These physicists on the list committed suicide one after another in less than two months," Chang Weisi said. With a thunderbolt from the blue sky, Wang Miao's mind went blank. Later, images gradually appeared in this blank space, which were his black and white landscape photos. In the photos, the earth did not have her figure, the sky erased her eyes, and those worlds died. "Is... when?" Wang Miao asked blankly. "In less than two months." General Chang repeated. "You mean the last one." Da Shi, who was sitting next to Wang Miao, said triumphantly, and then lowered his voice, "She was the last suicide victim. She took an overdose of sleeping pills the night before yesterday. She died smoothly and without pain. In an instant, Wang Miao felt so grateful to Da Shi. "Why?" Wang Miao asked, the dead landscape paintings in those photos were still recurring in his mind like a magic lantern. Chang Weisi replied: "Now there is only one thing that is certain: the reason that prompted them to commit suicide is the same. But the reason itself is difficult to explain here, and it may not be clear at all to us non-professionals. You can take a closer look at some of their suicide notes after the meeting." Wang Miao flipped through the copies of the suicide notes, and they were all long-winded. "Dr. Ding Yi, can you show Professor Wang Yang Dong's suicide note? Hers is the shortest and most comprehensive." The envelope was passed to Wang Miao across the table, and Da Shi whispered next to him, "He is Yang Dong's boyfriend." Then Wang Miao remembered that he had also met Ding Yi at the high-energy accelerator construction site in Liangxiang. Member of the Physicist, best known for his discovery of macroatoms in the study of ball lightning [1]. Wang Miao took out a piece of something that exuded a delicate fragrance from the envelope. The shape was irregular. It was not paper, but a piece of birch bark. There was a line of beautiful words on it: Everything leads to such a result: physics has never existed , will not exist in the future. I know it's irresponsible for me to do this, but I have no choice. Without even signing, she left. "Physics...doesn't exist?" Wang Miao looked around blankly. General Chang closed the folder, "There is some relevant specific information related to the experimental results obtained after the completion of the three new high-energy accelerators in the world. It is very professional, and we will not discuss it here. The first thing we'll investigate is the 'Boundaries of Science' society. UNESCO designated 2005 as the World Year of Physics. This organization was gradually born during the frequent academic conferences and exchange activities of the international physics community in this year. It is a loose international academic organization. Dr. Ding, you are a theoretical physics major, can you further introduce its situation? Ding Yi nodded and said, "I don't have any direct connection with Frontiers of Science, but this organization is well-known in academia." Its tenet is: Since the second half of the last century, the simplicity and power of classical physics theories have gradually disappeared, theoretical images have become more and more complex, blurred and uncertain, and experimental verification has become more and more difficult. It seems that the frontier exploration of physics has encountered great obstacles and difficulties. "Boundary of Science" tries to open up a new way of thinking, simply put, it is trying to find out the limitations of science with scientific methods, and trying to determine whether there is a bottom line in the depth and precision of science's cognition of nature—below the bottom line It cannot be entered by science. The development of modern physics seems to have vaguely touched this bottom line. " "very good. " Chang Weisi said, "As far as we know, most of these suicide scholars have had contact with 'Scientific Frontiers', and some are its members. But no crimes such as cult mind control or the use of illegal drugs were found. That is to say, even if the 'scientific boundary' has had an impact on those scholars, it is through legal channels of academic communication. Professor Wang, they have been in touch with you recently, and we would like to know something. Da Shi said gruffly, "Including the name of the contact person, the meeting place and time, the content of the conversation, if any written materials or e-mails have been exchanged..." "Da Shi! "Chang Weisi stopped him sharply. "If you don't say anything, no one will treat you as dumb!" A police officer next to him leaned over and whispered to Da Shi. The latter picked up the tea cup on the table, saw the cigarette butts inside, and put it down again with a "boom". Da Shi made Wang Miao feel like he had eaten it again. Feeling as uncomfortable as a fly, the trace of gratitude just now disappeared without a trace. But he still answered this question with restraint: "My contact with 'Science Frontier' began when I met Shen Yufei, a Chinese-Japanese physicist. My family, now working for a Japanese company, lives in this city. She used to work on nanomaterials at a Mitsubishi Electric lab, and we met at a technical seminar earlier this year. Through her, I met several physics majors, all of whom are members of 'Science Frontier', both at home and abroad. When interacting with them, we always talk about very... How should I put it, very ultimate issues, mainly the bottom line of science mentioned by Dr. Ding just now. " "I didn't have much interest in these questions at first, just as a pastime." I am engaged in applied research, and my level in this area is not high. I mainly listen to their discussions and arguments. These people have deep thoughts and novel viewpoints. I feel that communicating with them has broadened my mind a lot and gradually became more involved. But the topic of discussion is limited to this, and they are all pure theories, nothing special. They had invited me to join Frontiers of Science, but then attending such seminars would have become an obligation, and I declined due to limited energy. "Professor Wang, we hope that you will accept the invitation to join the 'Boundary of Science' society. This is also the main purpose of our invitation to you today." General Chang said, "We hope to get some internal information about this organization through your channel." " "Are you telling me to go undercover?" Wang Miao asked anxiously. "Wahhaha, undercover agent!" " Da Shi laughed out loud. Chang Weisi glanced at Da Shi reproachfully, and said to Wang Miao: "Just to provide some information, we have no other channels. Wang Miao shook her head, "I'm sorry, Chief. I can't do this. "Professor Wang, 'Science Frontiers' is an organization composed of top international scholars, and its investigation is an extremely complicated and sensitive matter, and we are really walking on thin ice." We hope you will understand this abrupt request as we cannot move forward without the help of the intellectual community. But we also respect your wishes, if you disagree, we can understand. " "I... I'm very busy with work and I don't have time. Wang Miao evaded. Chang Weisi nodded, "Okay, Professor Wang, then we won't waste your time anymore. Thank you for coming to this meeting." " Wang Miao was stunned for a few seconds before realizing that he should leave. When Chang Weisi politely sent Wang Miao to the door of the conference room, Da Shi said loudly from behind: "This is very good. I don't agree with this at all. plan. There are already so many nerds who have taken short-sightedness, isn't it 'meat buns beating dogs' to let him go? Wang Miao turned back and walked to Da Shi's side, trying to restrain her anger, "You really don't look like a qualified police officer when you speak like that." " "I wasn't in the first place." " "The reason why those scholars committed suicide has not been clarified yet. You shouldn't talk about them in such a contemptuous tone. Their contribution to human society with their own wisdom is irreplaceable by anyone. " "You mean they are better than me?" Da Shi looked up at Wang Miao from his chair, "I'm not going to commit suicide after listening to a few words from others." " "Then you mean I will?" "" You have to be responsible for your safety. Da Shi looked at Wang Miao, and showed his trademark smirk again. "In that situation, I am much safer than you. You should know that a person's ability to discern is directly proportional to his knowledge." "That's not necessarily true, someone like you..." "Da Shi, if you want to say one more thing, you should also get out from here!" "Chang Weisi sternly reprimanded. "It's okay, let him say," Wang Miao turned to General Chang, "I changed my mind and decided to join the 'Scientific Boundary' according to your intention." 2 "Very good," Da Shi nodded again and again, "Be smart when you go in, and you can do some things easily, such as glancing at their computers, remembering email addresses or URLs..." "Enough! enough! You misunderstood, I am not going undercover, I just want to prove your ignorance and stupidity! " "If you are still alive after a while, that will be proved of course." But I'm afraid... Hehe. Da Shi raised his head, and his smirk turned into a smirk. "Of course I will live forever, but I really don't want to see you again!" Chang Weisi sent Wang Miao down the stairs and arranged for a car to take him off. When saying goodbye, he said, "Shi Qiang has that kind of temper. In fact, he is a very experienced criminal policeman and anti-terrorism expert." More than twenty years ago, he was a soldier in my company. " Walking to the front of the car, Chang Weisi said again: "Professor Wang, you must have a lot of questions to ask. "What did what you just said have anything to do with the military?" " " Of course war has something to do with the military. Wang Miao looked at everything in the bright spring around him in bewilderment, "But where is the war?" Now there is no hotspot in the world, and it should be the most peaceful era in history. " Chang Weisi showed an inscrutable smile: "You will know everything soon, and everyone will know. Professor Wang, has there been any major change in your life? This sudden turn of events completely changes your life, and the world looks completely different to you overnight. " "No. "Then your life is a kind of accident. There are so many unpredictable factors in the world, but there are no accidents in your life." 1 Wang Miao thought for a long time and still didn't understand, "Most people are like this." "Then most people's life is accidental." "" But... so many generations have come here so plainly. " "It's all by chance." "Wang Miao shook her head and laughed, "I have to admit that my comprehension is too poor today. Don't you mean..." "Yes, the entire human history is also accidental. From the Stone Age to today, there have been no major changes. It's lucky. . But since it is lucky, there will always be an end; now I tell you, it is over, so prepare yourself mentally. 1 Wang Miao wanted to ask more questions, but the general shook hands with him and stopped him from asking further questions. After getting in the car, the driver asked for the address of Wang Miao's home. After Wang Miao told him, he asked casually, "Oh, pick me up." It's not you? I see the car is the same. " "It's not me, I'm going to pick up Dr. Ding." Wang Miao was moved, so he asked the driver where Ding Yi lived, and the driver told him. That night, he went to find Ding Yi.''')

            '''Pushing open the door of Ding Yi's brand new three-bedroom apartment, Wang Miao smelled a smell of alcohol, and saw Ding Yi lying on the sofa with the TV on, but his eyes were looking at the ceiling. Wang Miao looked around, and saw that the room hadn't been decorated much, and there was no furniture or furnishings. The spacious living room looked empty, and the most conspicuous thing was a pool table in the corner of the living room. 1. Ding Yi did not express any dislike for Wang Miao's uninvited visit. He obviously wanted to talk to someone. "I bought this house three months ago," Ding Yi said, "Why did I buy the house? Could she really come into the family?" He shook his head with a drunken smile. "You..." Wang Miao wanted to know everything about Yang Dong's life, but he didn't know how to ask. "She is like a star, always so far away, and the light that shines on me is always cold." Ding Yi walked to the window and looked at the night sky, as if looking for the star that had passed away. Wang Miao also fell silent. It's strange, he just wants to hear her voice now, at the moment when the sun was setting a year ago, she didn't speak at the moment when she looked into his eyes, he had never heard her voice. Ding Yi waved his hand, as if to drive away something, to free himself from this sad thought. "Professor Wang, you are right, don't get involved with the military and the police, they are a bunch of self-righteous idiots. The suicides of those physicists have nothing to do with the 'boundary of science'. I explained it to them, but I can't explain it. Clear." "They seem to have done some investigations." "Yes, and this investigation is on a global scale, so they should also know that two of them have no contact with 'Science Frontier', including Yang Dong. "Ding Yi seemed very struggling to say the name. "Ding Yi, you know, I'm also involved in this matter now. So, I really want to know the reason why Yang Dong made this choice, and I think you must know something." Wang Miao said clumsily , trying to cover up his true feelings. "If you know, you will only get involved more deeply. Now you are only involved with people and things, and after you know, even your spirit will be involved, so you will be in big trouble." "I am engaged in applied research, and I am not as theoretical as you So sensitive." "Well, have you ever played billiards?" Ding Yi walked to the pool table. "I played casually a few times when I was in school." "She and I like to play very much, because it reminds us of particle collisions in accelerators." Ding Yi said, picking up two black and white balls, and putting the black ball by the hole, Put the white ball only about ten centimeters away from the black ball, and ask Wang Miao, "Can you hit the black ball in?" "Anyone can do it this close." "Try." , knocking the black ball into the hole. "Very well, come on, let's change the table." Ding Yi greeted the confused Wang Miao, and the two lifted the heavy table and moved it to a corner of the living room near the window. After it was stabilized, Ding Yi took out the black ball from the ball bag, put it on the side of the hole, picked up the white ball, and put it about ten centimeters away from the black ball again, "This time I can still hit the ball." Go in?" "Of course." "Let's hit." Wang Miao easily hit the black ball into the hole again. "Move." Ding Yi waved his hand, and the two lifted the ball table again and moved it to the third corner of the living room. Ding Yi placed the black and white balls in the same position again, "Let's play." "I said, We..." "Let's play." Wang Miao smiled helplessly and hit the black ball into the hole for the third time. They moved the pool table twice more, once to the corner of the living room near the door, and then back to where it was the last time. Ding Yi placed the black and white ball in front of the hole twice, and Wang Miao hit the black ball into the hole twice. At this time, both of them were sweating a little. "Okay, the experiment is over, let's analyze the results." Ding Yi lit a cigarette and said, "We conducted a total of five experiments, four of which were at different spatial locations and different times, and two at the same time. The space location is different but the time is different. Aren't you shocked by the result?" He opened his arms exaggeratedly, "Five times, the results of the impact test are all the same!" "What exactly are you trying to express?" Wang Miao asked panting. "Now you explain this unbelievable result, using the language of physics." "This...in the five experiments, the mass of the two balls did not change; the position, of course, is based on the ball table As far as the frame of reference is concerned, there is no change; the velocity vector of the white ball hitting the black ball basically does not change, so the momentum exchange between the two balls also does not change, so of course the black ball was hit into the hole in the five trials." Ding Yi picked up a bottle of brandy left on the floor, filled two dirty glasses respectively, and handed a glass to Wang Miao, who declined. "It should be celebrated. We have discovered a great law: the laws of physics are uniform in time and space. All the physical theories in human history, from Archimedes' principle to string theory, and all the sciences of human beings so far Discoveries and thought achievements are all by-products of this great law. Compared with us, Einstein and Hawking are really ordinary people who engage in application." 1 "I still don't understand what you want to express." "Imagine another result: The first time, the white ball knocked the black ball into the hole; the second time, the black ball went off course; the third time, the black ball flew up to the ceiling; Fly, and finally got into your pocket; the fifth time, the black ball flew out at a speed close to the speed of light, knocked a gap in the edge of the pool table, penetrated the wall, and then flew out of the earth and out of the solar system, just like Ah What do you think at this moment?" Ding Yi stared at Wang Miao, who was silent for a long time before asking: "This really happened, didn't it?" 11 Ding Yi held the two He poured down his glasses of wine and stared straight at the pool table, as if it was a devil, "Yes, it happened. In recent years, the experimental verification conditions for basic theoretical research have gradually matured, and there are three expensive billiard balls. tables' were built, one in North America, one in Europe, and, of course, you know, in Liangxiang, China, where your nanocenter makes a lot of money." "These high-energy accelerators The energy has increased by an order of magnitude, which has never been achieved by human beings. Under the new collision energy level, the same particle, the same impact energy, and all the experimental conditions are the same, but the results are different. Not only in different accelerators The results are different, and they are also different in the experiments of the same accelerator at different times. Physicists panicked and repeated this ultra-high-energy impact experiment under the same conditions again and again, but each time the results were different and irregular. " "What does this mean?" Wang Miao asked, seeing Ding Yi staring at him silently, he added, "Oh, I work in nanometers, and I also touch the microscopic structure of matter, but it is several levels shallower than yours. , please advise." "This means that the laws of physics are not uniform in time and space." "What does this mean?" "You should be able to deduce it further, the general has figured it out, he is really a Smart people." Wang Miao looked out of the window in thought, the sea of lights outside the city was brilliant, and the stars in the night sky were so submerged that they couldn't be seen. "This means that the universal physical laws of the universe do not exist, so physics...doesn't exist either." Wang Miao said, looking away from the window. "'I know it's irresponsible for me to do this, but I have no choice.'" Ding Yi continued, "This is the second half of her suicide note, you just said the first half by accident, now I can somewhat understand Let her." Wang Miao picked up the white ball he had hit five times from the pool table, stroked it for a while and put it down gently, "This is indeed a disaster for a frontier theory explorer." "In the field of theoretical physics If you want to achieve something, you need a religious persistence, which can easily lead people to the abyss." When leaving, Ding Yi gave Wang Miao an address. "If you are free, please go and see Yang Dong's mother. Yang Dong has been living with her, and her daughter is the whole of her life. She is alone now, very pitiful." Wang Miao said: "Ding Yi, you You obviously know more than I do, so can't you reveal a little more? Do you really believe that the laws of physics are uneven in time and space?" "I don't know anything..." Ding Yi and Wang Miao looked at each other for a long time, and finally said : "This is a question." Wang Miao knew that he was just following the words of the British colonel: To be or not to be, this is a question. ''')

            '''The next day was the weekend, Wang Miao got up early instead, took a camera and rode a bicycle and went out. As a photographer, the subject he yearns for the most is the untouched wilderness, but he has no energy for such a luxurious enjoyment in his middle age, and he can only shoot landscapes in the city most of the time. Consciously or unintentionally, he chooses those corners of the city that exude a wild atmosphere, such as the dry lake bottom in the park, the new soil dug up on the construction site, and the weeds that drilled out of the cement cracks. In order to eliminate the gaudy colors of the city in the background, he only used black and white film. Unexpectedly, he became a school of his own and gradually became famous. His works were selected into two major film festivals and joined the Photographers Association. Every time he goes out to shoot, he just rides a bicycle around the city at will, capturing inspiration and the composition he needs, sometimes it takes a whole day to go around. Today, Wang Miao feels a little strange. His photography is known for its calm and dignified classical style, but today, it is difficult for him to find the sense of stability needed to create this kind of composition. In his feeling, this city that is waking up in the morning light seems to be built on quicksand. stability is illusory. In the night that just passed, those two billiard balls have been occupying his long dream. They flew irregularly in the black space, and the black balls could not be seen on the black background. They only occasionally blocked the white balls. Show your presence. 3 Is the essence of matter really irregular? Is the stability and order of the world just a short-term dynamic balance in a certain corner of the universe? Just a short-lived eddy in the chaotic turbulence? Before he knew it, he had ridden to the foot of the newly completed CCTV building. He stopped the car, sat on the side of the road, looked up at the towering A-shaped building, trying to find a sense of stability, and followed the direction of the building's spire shining in the rising sun, he looked towards the bottomless blue sky, Two words popped into my head: shooter, farmer. When discussing among scholars at the "Science Frontier", an acronym is often used: SF, which does not refer to science fiction, but an abbreviation of the above two words. This stems from two hypotheses, both concerning the nature of the laws of the universe. The "shooter" hypothesis: There is a sharpshooter who punches a hole every ten centimeters on a target. Imagine a two-dimensional intelligent creature living on the plane of this target. After observing their own universe, scientists among them discovered a great law: "every ten centimeters in the universe, there must be a hole." They Take this sharpshooter's random behavior on a whim as the iron law in his own universe. The "farmer hypothesis" has a layer of disturbing horror: there is a group of turkeys on a farm, and the farmer comes to feed them at eleven o'clock every day. A scientist in the turkey observed this phenomenon for nearly a year without exception, so it also discovered the great law in its own universe: "Every day at eleven o'clock in the morning, there is food." The law was announced to the turkeys in the morning, but this morning when the food did not come at eleven o'clock the farmer came in and caught and killed them all. 14 Wang Miao felt the road under his feet slipping like quicksand, and the A-shaped building seemed to shake, so he quickly looked away. Just to get rid of anxiety, Wang Miao forced himself to finish shooting a film and returned home before lunch. The wife took the children out to play and did not come back at noon. Normally, Wang Miao would be eager to develop the film, but today he has no interest at all. After a simple lunch, he fell asleep. Since he didn't sleep well last night, it was almost five o'clock when he woke up. Only then did he remember the film he had taken in the morning, so he went to the narrow darkroom converted from a closet to develop it. The film was developed quickly, and he began to check which one was worth enlarging and developing into a photo, and found a strange thing on the first one. This photo was taken of a small piece of grass outside a large shopping mall. He saw a row of white things in the middle of the negative, and a closer look was a row of numbers: 1200:00:00. The second negative also has numbers: 1199:49:33. A whole roll of film, with a small row of numbers on each negative! The third card: 1199:40:18; the fourth card: 1199:32:07; the fifth card: 1199:28:51; the sixth card: 1199:15:44; the seventh card: 1199:07:38; The eighth picture: 1198:53:09... The thirty-fourth picture: 1194:50:49; the thirty-sixth and last picture: 1194:16:37. Wang Miao immediately thought it was a problem with the film. He used a Leica M2 camera produced in 1988, which is fully mechanical and manual, without any automatic functions, and it is even more impossible to superimpose numbers such as dates on the film. Only with its excellent lens and mechanical mechanism, even in the digital age, it is the aristocrat among professional cameras. 3 Re-examining each negative, Wang Miao quickly discovered the first weirdness of these numbers: they automatically adapt to the background. If the background is black, the numbers are white, and the numbers on a white background are black, as if to create maximum contrast for the viewer to see. When Wang Miao looked at the sixteenth negative, his heartbeat quickened, and he felt a chill in the dark room rising up his spine: This shot is a dead tree with an old wall as the background, and the old wall is mottled. Black and white on the photo. On such a background, the row of numbers could not be displayed clearly in a normal position, whether it is black or white, but it stands upright, and bends itself, showing white along the dark trunk of the dead tree, looking as if It's a thin snake attached to a dead tree! Wang Miao began to study the mathematical relationship of those numbers. At first he thought it was some kind of serial number, but the intervals between each group of numbers were different. He soon realized that it was timekeeping in units of hours, minutes, and seconds. He took out his shooting notes, which recorded the shooting time of each photo in detail, down to the minute. He found that the difference in timing between the two photos was consistent with the time interval when they were actually taken. Apparently, the roll of film was reverse-recorded at a time that was passing at a realistic speed. Wang Miao immediately understood what it was. A countdown. The countdown started at 1200 hours, and there are still 1194 hours left. Now? No, it was the moment when the last frame of the film was shot. Is this countdown still going on? Wang Miao walked out of the dark room, took out a new black-and-white film and loaded it on the Leica camera, and quickly started shooting casually in the room, and finally went to the balcony to take a few outdoor pictures. When the film was finished, he took it out of the camera and headed into the darkroom to develop it. On the developed film, the number continued to appear ghostly on each negative, the first one was 1187:27:39, from the last shot of the previous roll to the first shot of this roll, exactly such a long time interval. The timing interval of each subsequent picture is three to four seconds, 1187:27:35, 1187:27:31, 1187:27:27, 1187:27:24... are the intervals of his rapid shooting. The countdown continues. Wang Miao loaded the camera with new film again, and took pictures quickly and randomly, some of which he took with the lens cap on purpose. When he took out the finished film, his wife and children came back. Before going to develop, he loaded the third film for Leica and handed the camera to his wife: "Come on, finish this roll." "What?" The wife looked at her husband in amazement. In the past, he never allowed other people to touch his camera. Of course, she and her son were not interested in that thing. In their eyes, it was a boring old antique bought for more than 20,000 yuan. "You can shoot whatever you want." Wang Miao stuffed the camera into his wife's hand and went into the dark room. "Then, Doudou, let me take a picture for you." The wife pointed the camera at her son. Wang Miao's mind suddenly appeared a phantom of ghostly numbers stretching in front of the child's face like an open noose, and he couldn't help but tremble slightly. "No, don't take pictures of your son, just take pictures of anything else." The shutter clicked, and the wife took the first picture, and then shouted, "Why can't I press it?" Wang Miao taught his wife to pull a handle, "This way , it has to be rewound every time.” Then he got into the dark room. 1 "It's really troublesome." The doctor's wife can't understand that in today's tens of millions of pixel digital cameras, there are still people using this outdated and expensive thing, and they still shoot black and white film. After the film was developed, facing the dim red light, Wang Miao saw that the countdown of the ghost was still going on. On the chaotic pictures taken randomly, including those taken with the lens cap on, it clearly showed Out: 1187:19:06, 1187:19:03, 1187:18:59, 1187:18:56... His wife knocked twice on the door of the darkroom and told him the filming was over. Wang Miao went out and grabbed the camera, his hands visibly trembling when taking the film. Regardless of his wife's strange gaze, he returned to the darkroom with the film and closed the door tightly. He worked in a hurry, developer and fixer spilled all over the floor, and the film was rushed out quickly. He closed his eyes and prayed silently: don't show up, no matter what it is, don't show up now, don't be my turn... he Using a magnifying glass to look along the wet film, the countdown disappeared, and only the indoor picture taken by his wife was on the negative. Under the low-speed aperture, the picture taken by her unprofessional operation was blurry, but Wang Miao felt that this was the picture he saw. The most pleasing photos ever. Wang Miao walked out of the dark room, took a deep breath, and found that her whole body was soaked in sweat. The wife went to the kitchen to cook, and the son also went to his room to play. He sat on the sofa alone and began to think a little calmly. First of all, this group of numbers that accurately records the passage of time at different shooting intervals and shows signs of intelligence cannot be reserved on film, but can only be sensitive to light by some kind of force. What could it be? Is it a camera problem? Was some kind of device placed into the camera, intentionally or not? He removed the lens, disassembled the camera, carefully observed the inside of the camera with a magnifying glass, checked every spotless and clean mechanism, and found nothing abnormal. Then, thinking of the pictures taken with the lens cap on, the most likely sensitive light source is some kind of strong penetrating rays from the outside world, but this is also technically impossible: where is the source of the rays? How to aim? This power is supernatural, at least as far as current technology is concerned. In order to further confirm that the ghost countdown had disappeared, Wang Miao loaded another film into the Leica camera and began to take random pictures one by one. When the film was released this time, he who had just calmed down for a while was pushed to the brink of madness: the ghost countdown appeared again. It doesn't show up on the volume. 1186:34:13, 1186:34:02, 1186:33:46, 1186:33:35... Wang Miao rushed out of the dark room, out of the house, and knocked on the neighbor's door. It was the retired Professor Zhang who opened the door. "Old Zhang, do you have a camera at home? Oh, don't use digital ones, use film ones!" Your face is so ugly." "Lend me some." Lao Zhang quickly brought a very ordinary Kodak digital camera. "Here, just delete a few pictures inside..." "Thank you!" Wang Miao grabbed the camera and film and hurried back to the house. In fact, there are three film cameras and one digital camera at home, but Wang Miao thinks it is more reliable to borrow from other places. He looked at the two cameras and a few black-and-white films spread out on the sofa. After thinking for a while, he loaded the Leica with film, and then handed the digital camera to his wife who was serving dinner: "Quick, take a few pictures, Just like just now!" "What is this for? Look at your face... What's wrong with you?!" The wife looked at him in horror. "Don't worry about it, shoot!" The wife put down the plate in her hand, walked over and looked at her husband, the horror in her eyes was added with worry. Wang Miao stuffed the Kodak camera into the hands of the six-year-old son who came over for dinner, "Doudou, help Dad take pictures. Just press this, yes, this is one picture; press it again, yes, yes, another picture; that's it!" Keep shooting, pointing at anywhere.” The son quickly grasped it, and the little guy was very interested and took pictures very quickly. Wang Miao turned around and picked up her own Lycra from the sofa, and started to take pictures too. The father and son went crazy and "clicked, clicked" like this, leaving his wife at a loss under the frequent flashes, tears welling up. "Wang Miao, I know you've been under a lot of pressure at work recently, so don't..." 1 Wang Miao finished shooting the film of the Leica camera, and snatched the digital camera from the child. He thought for a while, and in order to avoid the interference of his wife and children, he went to the bedroom and took a few photos with his digital camera. When he took pictures, he used a visual viewfinder instead of an LCD screen, because he was afraid of seeing the result, although sooner or later he had to see it. Wang Miao took out the film in the Lycra and went into the dark room, closed the door tightly and started to work. After the development was finished, he looked at the negative carefully. Because his hands were trembling, he could only hold the magnifying glass with both hands——on the negative, the ghostly countdown continued. Wang Miao rushed out of the dark room and began to check the photos on the digital camera. From the LCD screen, he saw that in the digital photos taken just now, the countdown was not displayed on the part taken by his son; Synchronized changes on negatives. Wang Miao used different cameras to shoot, in order to rule out the possibility that the problem was the camera or the film, but he inadvertently let the child shoot, and let his wife shoot before, and got an even weirder result: using different cameras and Shooting with different film, other people's photos are normal, the ghost countdown will only appear on the photos he took! Wang Miao desperately grabbed the pile of film, like a bunch of entangled snakes, and like a noose that was hard to break free. He knew that he couldn't solve this problem with his own strength alone, so who to go to? Colleagues in universities and research institutes can't do it. Like himself, they are all people with technical thinking; his intuition tells him that this matter has gone beyond technology. He thought of Ding Yi, but now this person himself is in a mental crisis. He ended up thinking of Frontiers of Science, a group of deep-thinking and active people. So, he dialed Shen Yufei's number. "Dr. Shen, I have something to do here, I must go to your place." Wang Miao said hastily. "Come on." Shen Yufei hung up the phone after saying these two words. Wang Miao was taken aback. Shen Yufei usually speaks very succinctly, so that some people in "Science Frontier" jokingly called her "female Hemingway". But this time, she didn't even ask about anything, Wang Miao didn't know whether to feel comforted or more disturbed. He stuffed the roll of film into a bag, took the digital camera with him, and rushed out of the house under the anxious eyes of his wife. He could have driven there, but even in this brightly lit city, he wanted company on the road, so he hailed a taxi. Shen Yufei lives in a high-end villa area near the Xincheng Railway Line. The lights here are much sparser, and the villas are surrounded by several small artificial lakes where fishing is possible. At night, there is a rural feeling. Shen Yufei is obviously very rich, but Wang Miao has never been able to figure out the source of her wealth. Neither her previous research position nor her current position in the company can earn so much money. But there was no sign of luxury in her villa, a meeting place at the Frontiers of Science, furnished like a small library with conference rooms. In the living room, Wang Miao saw Shen Yufei's husband, Wei Cheng. This man was about forty years old, and he looked like a honest intellectual. Wang Miao's understanding of him was limited to his name, and that was all Shen Yufei said in his introduction. He seems to have no job, stays at home all day, is not interested in the discussion of "scientific boundaries", and is accustomed to the frequent visits of scholars at home. But he's not just doing nothing, he's obviously working on something at home, he's lost in thought all day, he's absent-mindedly saying hello to anyone he sees, and then going back to the upstairs room where he spends most of the day . Once, Wang Miao inadvertently glanced in through the half-open door upstairs, and saw a surprising thing: an HP minicomputer. He couldn't be mistaken, because this device was the same as the one in the Superconductivity Research Center where he worked, with a black-gray chassis, and it was the RX8620 produced four years ago. It seems strange to keep this million-dollar device at home. What is Wei Cheng doing with it alone every day? "Yu Fei has something to do up there, please wait for a while." Wei Cheng said, and went upstairs. Wang Miao planned to wait, but couldn't sit still, so she followed her upstairs and saw Wei Cheng about to enter his room where the minicomputer was. He didn't seem to be disgusted when he saw Wang Miao coming. He pointed to a room opposite and said, "Oh, it's in that room. You can go find her." Wang Miao knocked on the door, but the door was unlocked and opened a crack. He saw Shen Yufei sitting in front of the computer playing games, and Wang Miao was surprised that she was wearing a "V suit". This is a very popular thing among gamers at present. It consists of a full-view display helmet and a set of induction suits. The induction suit can make players physically feel the blows, stabs and fires in the game, and can produce Extreme heat and cold, and even realistically simulate the feeling of the body exposed to the snow. Wang Miao walked behind her. Since the game was displayed in a full-view mode in the helmet, he couldn't see anything on the monitor. At this time, Wang Miao recalled that Da Shi asked him to remember the website and email address, and accidentally glanced at the monitor. The English name on the game login interface was very special, and he remembered it. Shen Yufei took off the display helmet, took off the induction suit, put on her pair of glasses that looked too big on her thin face, and nodded to Wang Miao expressionlessly, waiting for him to speak without saying a word. Wang Miao took out the roll of film and began to tell about the strange events that happened to her. Shen Yufei listened attentively. She picked up the films and glanced at them, but didn't look at them carefully—this shocked Wang Miao. Now that he was further sure that Shen Yufei was not completely ignorant of the matter, it almost made him stop. When talking about it, Shen Yufei only nodded several times to signal him to continue before finishing the story. Only then did Shen Yufei say the first sentence after they met: "How is the nano project you lead?" Wang Miao was very surprised by this far-fetched question. "NanoProject? What does it have to do with this?" He pointed to the stack of film. Shen Yufei didn't speak, but just looked at him quietly, waiting for him to answer her question. That's how she talks, never saying a word. "Stop the research." Shen Yufei said. "What?" Wang Miao thought she heard it wrong, "What did you say?" Shen Yufei remained silent and did not repeat herself. "Stop?! That's a national key project!" Shen Yufei still didn't speak, but just looked at him with calm eyes. "You have to tell me why!" "Stop and try." "What the hell do you know? Tell me!" "That's all I can tell you." "The project can't be stopped, and it can't be!" " Stop and try." The short talk about the ghost countdown ended here, after that, no matter how hard Wang Miao tried, Shen Yufei never said a word related to this, but just repeated that sentence: "Stop and try. "I understand now that 'Science Frontiers' is not an academic exchange organization for basic theories as you claim, and its relationship with reality is much more complicated than I imagined." Wang Miao said. "On the contrary, you get this impression because the 'scientific boundary' involves more fundamental things than you imagine." Desperate Wang Miao got up and left without saying goodbye. Shen Yufei silently escorted him to the gate of the courtyard, and watched Get him into a taxi. At this moment, another car sped up and stopped in front of the door. A man got out of the car, Wang Miao recognized him at a glance by the light from the villa. The man was Pan Han, one of the most famous characters in Frontiers of Science. As a biologist, he successfully predicted the genetic deformities of offspring caused by long-term consumption of genetically modified agricultural products, and also predicted the possible ecological disaster caused by genetically modified crops. Unlike the empty alarmists of academics, his prophecies are filled with specific details, and they are all fulfilled with such precision that they are so shockingly accurate that they are rumored to be from the future. Another initiative for which he made himself famous was the creation of the country's first experimental society. Unlike those utopian societies in the West that aim to return to nature, his "Chinese Garden" is not located in the wilderness, but in the largest city. The association has no property, and all daily necessities, including food, come from municipal waste. Contrary to people's initial expectations, the "Chinese Garden" has not only survived, but also grown rapidly. Its regular members have reached more than 3,000 people, and countless people come to experience life in it from time to time. 1 Building on these two successes, Pan Han's social thought became increasingly influential. He believes that the scientific and technological revolution is a disease of human society. The explosive development of technology is equivalent to the rapid spread of cancer cells. The final result is to exhaust the nutrients of the organism, destroy the organs, and lead to the death of its host. He advocated the abolition of those "brutal" technologies, such as fossil energy and nuclear power, and the retention of "moderate" technologies, such as solar energy and small hydropower. The big cities are gradually disbanded, the population is evenly distributed in small self-sufficient villages and towns, and a "new agricultural society" is established based on "moderate technology". 4 "Is he there?" Pan Han asked, pointing to the second floor of the villa. Shen Yufei didn't answer, and stood in front of him silently. "I want to warn him, and of course I also want to warn you, don't force us!" Pan Han said coldly. Shen Yufei still didn't answer him, but said to Wang Miao in the taxi, "Let's go, it's okay." Then she motioned for the driver to drive. After the car started, Wang Miao never heard what they said again. He turned his head and saw from a distance that Shen Yufei had never let Pan Han enter the villa under the light. It was already late at night when Wang Miao got home, and Wang Miao got out of the taxi at the gate of the community. A black Santana stopped close to him. The window was rolled down, and a puff of smoke spewed out. Packed to the brim. "Wow, Professor Wang, Academician Wang! How have you been these two days?" "Are you following me? How boring!" It’s like a donkey’s liver and lungs.” Da Shi showed his characteristic smirk, and looked like a rogue, “Why, did you see any useful information over there, exchange it?” “I said, I have nothing to do with you, from now on please don’t Follow me!" "Yeah—" Da Shi started the car, "It seems like I'm willing to earn these two night shifts, and the game is delayed." When Wang Miao walked into the house, his wife and children were already asleep, and he heard his wife Turning over restlessly on the bed, making an indistinct sound, her husband's weird behavior today, I don't know what kind of nightmare it will bring to her. Wang Miao took two tablets of Limianling, lay down on the bed, and fell asleep with difficulty after a long time. His dreams are chaotic, but one thing is constant: the ghostly countdown. In fact, Wang Miao had expected the countdown to appear in his dream. In the dream, he frantically hit the countdown suspended in mid-air, tearing it, biting it, but all the blows penetrated it feebly, and it hung in the middle of the dream, passing steadily. It made Wang Miao extremely irritable, and finally woke up from the dream. He opened his eyes and saw the blurry ceiling, with the lights of the city outside passing through the curtains, casting a dim halo on it. But one thing follows him from dream to reality: the ghostly countdown. The countdown was still visible in front of his open eyes, the numbers thin but bright with a searing white glow. 1185:11:34, 1185:11:33, 1185:11:32, 1185:11:31... Wang Miao turned her head, saw everything blurred in the bedroom, and confirmed that she had woken up and the countdown had not disappeared. He closed his eyes, the countdown still looming in his vision of total darkness, like quicksilver on black velvet. He opened his eyes again and rubbed them, the countdown still hadn't disappeared, no matter how his eyes moved, the string of numbers firmly occupied the center of his field of vision. An inexplicable fear made Wang Miao sit up abruptly, and followed him closely for the countdown. He jumped out of bed, rushed to the window, pulled back the curtains, and pushed the window open. The sleepy city outside is still brightly lit, and the countdown is displayed in front of this vast background, like subtitles on a movie screen. For a moment, Wang Miao felt that he was suffocating, and could not help but let out a low cry of surprise. Faced with the panicked inquiries from his awakened wife, he tried to calm himself down, comforted her and said it was nothing, then lay back on the bed, closed his eyes, and spent the rest of the night with difficulty under the light of the ghost countdown. After getting up early in the morning, Wang Miao tried her best to look normal in front of her family, but his wife still noticed something strange and asked him what happened to his eyes. Can't see something clearly? After breakfast, Wang Miao asked for leave from the Nano Center and drove to the hospital. Along the way, the ghost countdown ruthlessly lay in front of the real world in his eyes. This thing would automatically adjust its own brightness, and it would appear clearly on different backgrounds. Wang Miao even stared at the rising sun, trying to make the countdown temporarily hidden by the strong light for a while, but to no avail, the string of devil numbers actually appeared on the sun wheel. At this time, instead of increasing the brightness, it turned black, which was even more intense. fear. It was difficult to register at Tongren Hospital, so Wang Miao went directly to one of his wife's classmates, a famous ophthalmologist. He didn't say anything about his condition, but asked the doctor to check his eyes first. After careful examination of Wang Miao's eyes, the doctor told him that no pathological changes were found and everything was normal. "My eyes always see one thing, no matter where you look, this thing is there." Wang Miao said. At the same time, the string of numbers was lying in front of the doctor's face. 1175:11:34, 1175:11:33, 1175:11:32, 1175:11:31... "Floaters." The doctor said, and at the same time took out the prescription and began to write, "The common eye disease of our age, the lens Cloudiness. Not easy to treat, but it’s nothing serious. Prescribe some iodine and vitamin D. Maybe it can be absorbed, but there is little hope. However, it really doesn’t matter, as long as you get used to ignoring the debris in your vision , has no effect on vision." "The floaters you mentioned, what do those... things look like?" "Irregular, it varies from person to person, sometimes they are small black spots, sometimes they look like tadpoles." "If you look Did you get a string of numbers?" The doctor stopped writing the prescription. "You see a string of numbers?" "Yes, it's in the center of your field of vision." The doctor pushed away the paper and pen, and looked at him with concern. Yao mentioned you to me and said that your work pressure is very high. At our age, we should pay attention, and our health can’t afford to be exhausted." "You mean, I am caused by mental factors?" The doctor nodded, " If it's an ordinary patient, I would suggest that he go to the psychiatrist. Actually, it's not necessary, it's nothing important, it's just that he's too tired. Let's take a few days off, go on vacation, and Li Yao, the child, what's your name, Dou Bean, let's go together. Don't worry, it will recover soon." 1175:10:02, 1175:10:01, 1175:10:00, 1175:09:59... "I'll tell you what I saw , A countdown! Second by second, walking accurately! Could this be a mental factor?" The doctor smiled tolerantly, "Do you want to know to what extent mental factors can affect vision? Last month we admitted a girl At the age of fifteen or sixteen, she suddenly lost sight of everything in the classroom and was completely blind. But after all examinations, her eyes were completely normal physically. Later, a psychiatrist gave her psychological treatment for a month, and again Suddenly, her eyes returned to a normal level of vision." Wang Miao knew that it was a waste of time here, so he got up to leave, and finally said: "Well, regardless of my eyes, I only have one question to ask you: Is there a problem? What kind of external force can make people see something through remote action?" The doctor thought for a while and said: "Yes, I participated in the medical team of Shenzhou 19 a while ago, and some astronauts reported that they could see when they were working outside the cabin. There is a flash of light that does not exist. The astronauts on the International Space Station have reported similar situations before. When the solar activity is intense, high-energy particles in space hit the retina, and people see the flash. But you said you saw it The numbers, or the countdown, can never be the reason." Wang Miao walked out of the hospital in a daze, the countdown was right in front of his eyes, and he seemed to be following it, followed by a ghost that was haunting him. He bought a pair of sunglasses and put them on, just to prevent others from seeing his sleepwalking blurred eyes. Wang Miao walked into the main laboratory of the Nano Center, and did not forget to take off his sunglasses before entering the door. Even so, the colleagues who met him showed worried expressions about his mental state. In the center of the experiment hall, Wang Miao saw that the reaction black box was still in operation. The main body of this gigantic device is a sphere with a collection of pipes. The super-strength nanomaterial code-named "Flying Blade" has been produced, but it is manufactured by molecular construction technology, which is to use molecular probes to build material molecules one by one like bricks. This process consumes a lot of resources. Those products can be said to be the most precious treasures in the world, and they cannot be mass-produced at all. What the laboratory is doing now is trying to replace the molecular construction method through a catalytic reaction, so that a huge number of molecules can complete the building at the same time during the reaction. The test is carried out in the reaction black box. This equipment can perform reaction tests on a large number of component combinations. Such a number of combinations may not be completed fo''')

            '''Wang Miao dialed Ding Yi's phone number. After the other party answered, he realized that it was already past one o'clock in the morning. 2 "I'm Wang Miao, I'm really sorry to bother you so late." "It's okay, I'm having insomnia." "I... have encountered something, and I would like to ask you for your help. Do you know that there is an institution in China that observes the cosmic background radiation? ?” Wang Miao felt a desire to confide, but immediately felt that it was better not to let more people know about the ghost countdown. "Cosmic background radiation? Why do you have an interest in this? It seems that you really encountered something... Have you ever visited Yang Dong's mother?" 2 "Ah—I'm sorry, I forgot." "It's okay , Now in the scientific world, many people are... as you said, they encountered some things and were absent-minded. But you'd better go and see her, she is old and unwilling to hire a nanny, if there is any trouble Please help me with this matter... Oh, about the cosmic background radiation, you can just ask Yang Dong's mother, she majored in astrophysics before she retired, and is very familiar with such research institutions in China." "Okay, I'll go after work today." "Thank you in advance, I really can't face everything related to Yang Dong anymore." After making the phone call, Wang Miao sat in front of the computer and began to print out the information displayed on the webpage. The very simple Morse code comparison table. At this moment, he had calmed down, moved his thoughts away from the countdown, and thought about "Boundary of Science" and Shen Yufei, and thought of the online games she played. About Shen Yufei, the only thing he can be sure of is that she is not a gamer. The only impression he has of this woman who speaks like a telegram is that she is cold. Her coldness is different from some other women. Mask, but cold from the inside out. Wang Miao always subconsciously associates her with the long-disappeared DOS operating system. There is an empty black screen, only a simple "C:>" prompt is flashing, and it will output whatever you input. Nothing, not a single word, and there will be no change. Now he knows that behind the "C:>" prompt is actually a bottomless abyss. She is really interested in playing games, and playing in a V suit? She has no children, so the V suit can only be bought by herself, which is a bit unbelievable. Wang Miao entered the easy-to-remember game URL: www.threebody.com in the address bar of the browser, and the web page showed that the game only supported the V-suit method. Wang Miao remembered that there seemed to be a set of V equipment in the staff recreation room of the Nano Center, so he walked out of the empty central experiment hall, went to the duty room to get the key, passed through a row of billiard tables and fitness equipment in the recreation room, and sat on a I found the V suit next to the computer, put on the induction suit after a lot of effort, put on the display helmet, and started the computer. 2 After starting the game, Wang Miao was in a wasteland at dawn. The wasteland was dark brown, and the details could not be seen clearly. There was a small piece of white dawn on the horizon in the distance, and the rest of the sky was full of stars. With a loud noise, two red mountain peaks fell to the distant land, and the whole wasteland was shrouded in red light. After the aroused dust that covered the sky and the sun dispersed, Wang Miao could clearly see the two big characters that towered above the sky: Three Body. Then a registration interface appeared. Wang Miao registered with the ID "Hairen" and successfully logged in. The wasteland was still there, but the compressor in the V-suit induction suit started hissing, and Wang Miao felt a chill. Ahead appeared two walking figures, black silhouettes against a background of dawn. Wang Miao chased after them, and he saw that both of them were men, wearing tattered robes and a piece of dirty animal skin, both carrying a broad and short sword like that of the Bronze Age. One carried a slender wooden box half his height. The man turned his head to look at Wang Miao. His face was as dirty and wrinkled as the animal skin, but his eyes were full of energy, reflecting the dawn light. "It's cold," he said. "Yes, it's really cold." Wang Miao agreed. "This is the Warring States Period, and I am King Wen of Zhou." The man said. "Isn't King Wen of Zhou from the Warring States Period?" Wang Miao asked. "He has lived until now, and so has King Zhou." Another person without a suitcase on his back said, "I am a follower of King Wen of Zhou, and my ID is 'Follower of King Wen of Zhou'. He is a genius." "My ID is 'Sea People'," Wang Miao said, "What is that on your back?" King Wen of Zhou put down the rectangular wooden box, and opened a facade like a door, revealing the five-story square inside. In the light of the morning sun, Wang Miao could see a small pile of fine sand between each floor, and in each floor there was a trickle of sand flowing down from the previous floor. "The hourglass leaks once every eight hours, and if it's turned upside down three times, it's a day. But I often forget to turn it upside down, and I have to rely on followers to remind me." Zhou Wenwang said. "You seem to be traveling a long distance. Is it necessary to carry such a heavy timer?" "Then how do you time it?" "It's so convenient to take a small sundial, or you can know the approximate time just by looking at the sun." King Wen of Zhou He and his followers looked at each other, and then stared at Wang Miao together as if he was an idiot, "The sun? How can you tell the time by looking at the sun? This is a chaotic era." Wang Miao was about to ask the meaning of this weird term, when the follower wailed: "It's so cold! Ah, I'm so cold!" Wang Miao also felt cold, but he couldn't take off the induction suit casually, under normal circumstances, doing so would cause his ID to be canceled by the game. He said: "When the sun comes out, it will be warmer." "Are you pretending to be a great prophet? Even King Wen of Zhou is not a prophet!" The followers shook their heads disdainfully at Wang Miao. "Does this require a prophet? Who can't see that the sun will rise in an hour or two." Wang Miao said, pointing to the sky. "This is Chaos!" said the follower. "What is a chaotic era?" "Except for the constant era, they are all chaotic eras." King Wen of Zhou said, as if answering a question from an ignorant child. Sure enough, the morning light in the sky began to dim, and soon disappeared, and the night covered everything again, and the sky was full of stars. "So it's dusk and not morning?" Wang Miao asked. "It's morning. The sun may not rise in the morning. This is a chaotic era." The cold made Wang Miao feel very uncomfortable. "Look at it, it will be a long time before the sun rises." He said tremblingly, pointing to the blurred horizon. "Why do you have such an idea again? That's not necessarily true. This is a chaotic era." The follower turned to King Wen of Zhou, "Ji Chang, give me some dried fish." "No!" King Wen of Zhou said decisively, "I'm barely full too. Make sure I can walk to Chaoge instead of you." While speaking, Wang Miao noticed another dawn appeared on the horizon in another direction. The direction in which to appear. The dawn quickly intensified, and after a while, the sun of this world rose. It was a small blue sun, much like the brightened moon, but it still made Wang Miao feel a bit of warmth, and he could clearly see the nature of the earth. detail. But the day was short, the sun set in a shallow arc above the horizon, and night and cold enveloped everything again. The three of them stopped in front of a dead tree. King Wen of Zhou and his followers pulled out their bronze swords to chop firewood. Wang Miao gathered the pieces of firewood together. The follower took out the scythe, crackled and crackled for a while, and a fire was raised. The front chest of Wang Miao's induction suit became warmer, but the back was still cold. "Burn some dehydrated people, and the fire will flourish." Followers said. "Shut up! That's what King Zhou did! In comparison, a few lives are nothing." "Nonsense! We are scholars!" After the bonfire was burnt out, the three of them continued on their way. Because there was little conversation between them, the system speeded up the passage of game time. King Wen of Zhou quickly turned the hourglass on his back six times. In the blink of an eye, two days passed without the sun rising even once There are no shadows. "It seems that the sun won't come out." Wang Miao said, and at the same time called up the game interface to check his HP, which was rapidly decreasing due to the cold. "You are pretending to be a great prophet again..." the follower said, and Wang Miao said the second half of the sentence together with him, "This is a chaotic era!" In a blink of an eye the sun rose. Wang Miao found that a big sun rose this time, and when it reached halfway, its diameter occupied at least one-fifth of the horizon in the field of vision. The warm current hit his face, making Wang Miao feel relaxed and happy, but when he looked at Zhou Wenwang and his followers, he found that they all looked terrified, as if the devil had descended. "Quickly, find a shady place!" The followers shouted, and Wang Miao ran to follow them, ran to a low rock and squatted down. The shadow of the rock is gradually shortening, the surrounding land is as dazzling as incandescent state, the permafrost under the feet melts rapidly, from as hard as iron to muddy, and the heat wave is billowing. Wang Miao soon began to sweat. When the big sun rose directly above their heads, the three of them covered their heads with animal skins, and the strong light still shot in from all the cracks and holes like sharp arrows. The three of them moved around the rock to the other side, hiding in the shadow that just appeared over there... After the sun set, the air was still extremely hot, and the three of them sat on the rock dripping with sweat. Traveling, walking in hell, I can't take it anymore; besides, I don't have anything to eat, you don't give me some dried fish, and you don't let me eat dehydrated people, alas—" "Then you can only be dehydrated." Zhou Wen Wang said, fanning the wind with the animal skin with one hand. "After dehydration, you won't abandon me, right?" "Of course not, I promise to take you to Chaoge." The follower took off his sweat-soaked robe and lay naked on the mud floor. In the afterglow of the setting sun, Wang Miao saw that the sweat on the follower's body suddenly increased, and he quickly knew that it was not sweating, the water in the man's body was being completely drained, and the water formed several small lines on the sand. the stream, the whole body of the follower was softening and thinning like a melting candle... Ten minutes later, the water drained, and the body turned into a piece of human-shaped soft skin lying motionless on the muddy floor, and the facial features were all blurred Cleared up. "Is he dead?" Wang Miao asked. He remembered, along the way, he saw such human-shaped soft skins from time to time, some of which were damaged and incomplete. They were the dehydrated ones that the followers wanted to use to light the fire not long ago. "No." Zhou Wenwang said, picked up the follower's soft skin, patted the soil on it, put him (it) on the rock and rolled him (it), just like rolling a deflated rubber ball , "After soaking in water for a while, he will return to his original shape and come back to life, just like soaking dried mushrooms." "His bones have also softened?" "Yes, they have become dry fibers, so they are easy to carry." " Can everyone in this world be dehydrated?" "Of course, you can too, otherwise, you won't be able to survive in the Chaotic Era." King Wen of Zhou handed the rolled followers to Wang Miao, "Take him with you. It was either burned or eaten when it was thrown on the road." Wang Miao took the soft skin, a very light roll, and it didn't feel strange to hold it between her arms. Wang Miao carried the dehydrated follower between them, and Zhou Wenwang carried the hourglass on his back, and the two continued their difficult journey. As in the previous few days, the sun in this world moves completely erratically, and after several long cold nights, there may be a sudden hot day, or vice versa. The two depended on each other, resisting the severe cold by the campfire and soaking in the lake to survive the extreme heat. Fortunately, the game time can be accelerated, and a month can be completed in half an hour, which makes the journey of Chaos Era bearable. On this day, the long night had lasted for nearly a week (according to the hourglass), King Zhou Wen suddenly pointed to the night sky and cheered: "Flying stars! Flying stars! Two flying stars!!" It is a strange celestial body, it is bigger than a star, it can show the shape of a disc the size of a ping-pong ball, and it moves very fast. The naked eye can clearly see it moving in the starry sky, but this time there are two. Zhou Wenwang explained: "Two flying stars appear, and the constant era is about to begin!" "I have seen it before." "There is only one." "Is there only two at most?" "No, sometimes there are three, But there won’t be any more.” “Does the appearance of three flying stars herald a better era?” King Wen of Zhou gave Wang Miao a look full of fear, “What are you talking about, three flying stars… ... Pray that it doesn’t appear.” King Wen of Zhou’s words were correct, the constant era they longed for soon began, the sun’s rising and setting began to become regular, and a day and night gradually fixed at about eighteen hours, and day and night regularly alternated. The weather has gotten a little warmer. "How long can the Constant Era last?" Wang Miao asked. "A day or a century, no one can tell how long each time is." Zhou Wenwang sat on the hourglass and looked up at the noon sun. Blessed are those who were born in that era." "How long will the chaotic era last?" "Didn't I say that, except for the constant era, both are chaotic eras, and the two are gaps between each other." "That is to say , This is a chaotic world with no laws?!" "Yes, civilization can only develop in a long constant epoch with a warm climate. Most of the time, human beings are collectively dehydrated and stored. When it comes, collectively immerse in resurrection, production and construction." "Then how to predict the time and length of the arrival of each constant era?" "It can't be done, it has never been done before. King Yu's intuition is often: Soaking revives, crops are planted, towns begin to be built, life has just begun, and the Heng Era is over, and the severe cold and heat will destroy everything." Zhou Wenwang pointed to Wang Miao with one hand. , his eyes became bright, "Okay, you already know the goal of this game: to use our intelligence and understanding to analyze and study various phenomena, and to master the laws of the sun's movement. The survival of civilization depends on this." "In my opinion, the movement of the sun has no laws at all." "That's because you failed to realize the origin of the world." "Have you realized it?" "Yes, this is the purpose of my going to Chaoge, and I will Present an accurate perpetual calendar to King Zhou." "But along the way, I haven't seen you have this ability." "The prediction of the sun's movement can only be made in Chaoge, because there is the meeting point of yin and yang. Only the hexagrams taken there are accurate." The two trekked through the harsh Chaos Era for a long time, during which they experienced a short Heng Era, and finally arrived at Chaoge. Wang Miao heard an uninterrupted thunderous roar. This sound was made by many strange things on the land of Chaoge. They were huge pendulums, each tens of meters high. The pendulums of the pendulums are boulders suspended from a bridge between two tall slender stone towers by a large bundle of ropes. Every simple pendulum is swinging. They were driven by groups of soldiers in armor. They chanted strangely and pulled the rope tied to the boulder's pendulum with all their strength to keep it swinging. Wang Miao found that all the swings of the giant pendulums were synchronized. From a distance, this scene was so weird and fascinating, like moving clocks erected on the ground, and like many huge, abstract symbols falling from the sky. Surrounded by the giant pendulum, there is a huge pyramid, like a towering black mountain in the night, this is the palace of King Zhou. Wang Miao followed King Wen of Zhou into a low-rise door on the base of the pyramid, and several soldiers guarding the door wandered silently like ghosts in the darkness. They walked down a long tunnel, narrow and dark, with only one torch at a distance. "During the Chaotic Era, the whole country was dehydrated, but King Zhou was always awake, accompanying this lifeless land. If you want to survive in the Chaotic Era, you have to live in this kind of building with extremely thick walls, almost like living In the ground, you can avoid the severe cold and heat." King Wen of Zhou explained to Wang Miao as he walked. After walking a long way, I entered King Zhou's main hall located in the center of the pyramid. In fact, it is not very big, it looks like a cave. The person wearing a large flowered animal skin and sitting on a high platform is obviously King Zhou, but the first thing that caught Wang Miao's attention was a man in black. His black clothes almost blended with the heavy shadows in the hall , that pale face seemed to be floating in the void. "This is Fuxi." King Zhou introduced the man in black to King Wen of Zhou and Wang Miao who had just entered, as if they had been there all along, and the man in black was a newcomer. "He thought that the sun was grumpy. When he is awake, he is moody and angry, which is chaotic era; when he is asleep, he breathes evenly, which is constant era. Fu Yi suggested erecting those big pendulums outside, swinging day and night, claiming that it has a strong influence on the sun god The hypnotic effect can make it fall into a long slumber. But until now, we see that the sun god is still awake, at most he just dozes from time to time." King Zhou waved his hand, and someone brought a clay pot and put it in Fuyi. On the small stone platform in front of him—Wang Miao found out later that it was a jar of seasoning. Fu Yi let out a long sigh, picked up the earthen pot and drank it, the gurgling sound seemed to be a huge heart beating deep in the darkness. After drinking half of it, he poured the rest of the seasoning on himself, then threw down the clay pot, walked to a big bronze cauldron on fire in the corner of the hall, and climbed up the edge of the cauldron; A big cloud of steam. "Sit down, Ji Chang, the banquet will start soon." King Zhou pointed to the big cauldron and said. "Stupid sorcery." Zhou Wenchao's cauldron tilted his head and said contemptuously. "What did you realize about the sun?" King Zhou asked, the firelight dancing in his eyes. "The sun is not a great god. The sun is yang, and the night is yin. The world revolves in a balance of yin and yang. This is not under our control, but it can be predicted." King Zhou Wen said, drawing out his bronze sword, and placed it on the floor illuminated by the torch. Draw a pair of big yin-yang fishes on it, and then draw sixty-four hexagrams around it at a dizzying speed, which looks like big annual rings appearing and disappearing in the firelight, "My lord, this is the code of the universe." , with the help of it, I will present an accurate perpetual calendar for your dynasty." "Ji Chang, what I urgently need to know now is when the next Changheng Era will come." "I will immediately divination for you." Zhou Wen As Wang said, he walked to the center of the yin-yang fish and sat down cross-legged. He looked up at the top of the hall, his eyes seemed to see the starry sky through the thick pyramid, and his hands and fingers were performing complex movements at the same time, forming a high-speed operation. calculator. In the silence, only the soup in the cauldron made a gurgling sound, as if the wizard cooking in the soup was talking in his sleep. King Wen of Zhou stood up from the yin and yang diagram, with his head still up, and said: "The following will be a period of forty-one chaotic eras, and then there will be a five-day period of constant era, followed by a period of twenty-three days. The era and the eighteen-day constant era, and then the eight-day chaotic era, when the chaotic era is over, my lord, the Changheng era that you are looking forward to will come. This constant era will last for three years and nine years Month, during which the climate is warm, is a golden age." "We first need to confirm your previous prediction." King Zhou said calmly. Wang Miao heard a rumbling sound from above, and a stone slab on the top of the hall slid away, revealing a square hole. Wang Miao adjusted the direction and saw that this square hole led to the outside of the pyramid. At the end, Wang Miao saw several twinkling stars. The game time sped up, and the hourglass brought by King Wen of Zhou, guarded by two soldiers, flipped every few seconds to mark the passage of eight hours. The window above flickered irregularly, and from time to time a beam of chaotic era sunlight shot into the hall, sometimes it was very faint, like moonlight; Wang Miao counted the number of times the hourglass was flipped, and when it reached about 120 times, the intervals between the sunlight falling into the window became regular, and the predicted first constant epoch came. After the hourglass flipped fifteen more times, the flickering of the window became disordered again, and the chaotic era began again. Then came the Constant Era, and then the Chaotic Era. Although there were some small errors in their start and duration, they were quite consistent with Zhou Wenwang's prediction. When the last eight-day chaotic era ended, the eternal era he predicted began. Wang Miao counted the flips of the hourglass. Twenty days had passed, and the sunlight entering the hall still followed a precise rhythm. At this time, the lapse of game time is adjusted to normal. King Zhou nodded to King Wen of Zhou: "Ji Chang, I will erect a monument for you, which will be taller than this palace." King Wen of Zhou bowed deeply: "My lord, let your dynasty wake up. Prosper!" King Zhou stood up on the stone platform, opened his arms, as if to embrace the whole world, and shouted in a strange singing tone: "Soak—" Hearing this order, everyone in the hall ran away To the cave door. At the direction of King Wen of Zhou, Wang Miao followed him along the long tunnel to the outside of the pyramid. Walking out of the cave, Wang Miao saw that it was noon, the sun was shining quietly in the sky, and the breeze was blowing, and he seemed to smell the breath of spring. King Zhou Wen and Wang Miao came to a lake not far from the pyramid. The ice on the lake had melted, and the sunlight was beating among the microwaves. A group of soldiers who came out first shouted: "Soak! Soak!" They all rushed to a tall stone building shaped like a barn by the lake. On the way here, Wang Miao saw this kind of building in the distance from time to time. Zhou Wenwang told him that it was a "dry warehouse", a large warehouse for storing dehydrated people. The soldiers opened the stone door of the dry warehouse and took out rolls of dusty leather rolls. Each of them carried several leather rolls in their arms, walked to the lake, and threw those rolls into the lake. As soon as those skin rolls touched the water, they stretched out immediately, and for a while, a thin human figure that seemed to be cut out floated on the lake. Each "human piece" is rapidly absorbing water and swelling, and gradually, the "human pieces" on the lake surface have turned into round flesh, and these fleshy bodies soon showed signs of life, one by one struggling from the waist-deep Stand up in the lake. They looked at this sunny world with wide open eyes like waking up from a dream. "Soak!" A person shouted, and immediately a crowd of cheers came: "Soak! Soak!!"... These people ran ashore from the lake, ran to the dry warehouse naked, and put more skin rolls into the dry warehouse. In the lake, groups of resurrected people ran out of the lake. This scene also takes place in lakes and ponds farther afield, and the whole world comes to life. "Oh, my God! My finger—" Wang Miao followed the voice and saw a newly revived person standing in the lake and crying while holding up a hand. Finger dripping into the lake. The other resurrected ones flocked past him, running happily to the shore of the lake, and no one paid him any attention. "Okay, you can be content!" said a resurrected person who passed by, "Some people have lost their entire arms and legs, and some people have had a hole in their head. If we don't soak it, we are afraid that we will all be gnawed by the rats of the chaotic era." Light!" "How long have we been dehydrated?" another resurrected asked. "Just look at how thick the sand and dust accumulated on the king's palace. I just heard that the current king is no longer the king before dehydration. I don't know if it is his son or grandson." The soaking lasted for eight days before it was completely over. At this time All dehydrated people have been resurrected, and the world has been born again. During these eight days, people enjoy the sunrise and sunset of 20 hours a day with accurate cycle. Bathed in the breath of spring, everyone sincerely praised the sun and the gods in charge of the universe. On the night of the eighth day, the bonfires on the earth are denser than the stars in the sky, and the deserted towns in the long chaotic era are full of lights and noise, just like the countless soaks before civilization, everyone will revel all night and welcome the sunrise new life after. But the sun never rose again. Various timers indicated that the time for sunrise had passed, but the horizon was still dark in every direction. Another ten hours passed without a shadow of the sun, not even the faintest gleam of morning light. One day passed, and the endless night continued; two days passed, and the cold pressed down on the earth like a giant palm in the dark night. "Please believe me, Your Majesty, this is only temporary. I see the sun gathering in the universe. The sun is about to rise. The constant era and spring will continue!" Under the stone platform begged. "Let's burn the cauldron." King Zhou said with a sigh. "Your Majesty! Your Majesty!" A minister stumbled in from the cave and shouted in a crying voice, "There are three flying stars in the sky!!" Everyone in the hall was stunned, and the air seemed to freeze. Only King Zhou remained calm. He turned to Wang Miao, who had been scornful of him before, "You still don't know what the appearance of three flying stars means? Ji Chang, tell him." Powder." King Wen of Zhou sighed and said. "Dehydration—" King Zhou shouted again in that singing voice. In fact, on the land outside, people have already started to dehydrate one after another, and turned into human stems again to spend the long night. The lucky ones among them were moved back into dry warehouses, and a large number of human stems were discarded in the wilderness. King Wen of Zhou stood up slowly and walked towards the big bronze cauldron on the fire. He climbed up the edge of the cauldron and paused for a few seconds before jumping in. Perhaps he saw Fuxi's overcooked face slapping him lightly in the soup. laugh. "Use a slow fire." King Zhou said weakly, and then turned to the others, "Exit the one who should exit, the game is no fun here." 3 A red lighted EXIT sign appeared above the cave door, and people flocked. go there. Wang Miao also followed, passing through the cave gate and the long tunnel to the outside of the pyramid, seeing heavy snow falling in the dark night, and the biting cold made him shiver. A corner of the sky shows that the game time has sped up again. Ten days later, the snow was still falling, but the flakes were large and thick, like congealed darkness. Someone whispered in Wang Miao's ear, "This is carbon dioxide dry ice." Wang Miao turned around and saw that it was a follower of King Wen of Zhou. Ten days later, the snow was still falling, but the snowflakes had become thin and transparent, showing a detached light blue in the twilight of the torches shining through the entrance of the pyramid, like countless flying mica flakes. "The snowflakes are already solidified oxygen and nitrogen, and the atmosphere is disappearing in absolute zero." The pyramid was buried by snow, the bottom layer was snow of water, the middle layer was snow of dry ice, and the upper layer was snow of solid oxygen and nitrogen. The night sky became very clear, and the stars were like a silver flame. A line of words appeared on the background of the starry sky: This night lasted for forty-eight years, civilization No. 137 was destroyed in the severe cold, and this civilization evolved to the Warring States level. The seeds of civilization are still there, and it will restart and start the unpredictable evolution in Trisolaran again. You are welcome to log in again. Before exiting, the last thing Wang Miao noticed were three flying stars in the night sky. They were very close to each other and surrounded each other, dancing some kind of weird dance in the abyss of space.''')

            '''After Wang Miao took off the V suit, she found that her underwear was soaked in cold sweat, as if she had woken up from a cold nightmare. He walked out of the nanometer center, went downstairs to drive, and went to Yang Dong's mother's house at the address given by Ding Yi. Chaotic era, chaotic era, chaotic era... This concept lingered in Wang Miao's mind. Why is the sun running irregularly in that world? A planet of a star, no matter whether its orbit is a perfect circle or an elongated ellipse, its movement around the star must be periodic, and it is impossible to run without any rules...Wang Miao was suddenly annoyed with himself, he tried hard He shook his head and tried to get rid of all this in his mind, it was just a game, but he failed. Chaotic era, chaotic era, chaotic era...Damn it! Don't think about it! ! Why do you have to think about it? Why? ! Soon, Wang Miao found the answer. He has not played video games for many years, and the software and hardware technology of video games has obviously improved a lot over the years, and the virtual reality scenes and additional effects in them are unmatched by his student days. But Wang Miao understands that the reality of "Three-Body Problem" does not lie in this. I remember that in an information class in my junior year, the professor hung up two large pictures, one was a picture of "Surfing the River at Qingming Festival", and the other was a picture of an empty sky, with only a wisp of light on the empty blue sky. White clouds that seem to exist and seem to exist. The professor asked which of the two paintings contained the greater amount of information, and the answer was that the latter was one to two orders of magnitude larger than the former! "The Three-Body Problem" is exactly like this. Its massive information is hidden in the depths. Wang Miao can feel it, but can't explain it clearly. He suddenly realized that the unusual thing about "Three-Body Problem" is that compared with other games, its designers did the opposite - the designers of general games try to increase the amount of information displayed as much as possible. However, the designers of "Three-Body Problem" tried their best to compress the amount of information to hide a certain huge reality, just like the photo of the seemingly empty sky. Wang Miao let go of the reins of his mind and let him return to the world of "Three-Body Problem". flying star! The key lies in the unobtrusive flying stars, one flying star, two flying stars, three flying stars... What do these mean? Just as he was thinking, the car had already driven to the gate of the community he was going to. At the door of the building she was going to, Wang Miao saw a thin, gray-haired woman in her sixties, wearing glasses, struggling up the stairs with a large vegetable basket. He guessed that she was probably the person he was looking for, and when he asked, she was indeed Yang Dong's mother, Ye Wenjie. After listening to Wang Miao's explanation of her intentions, she was moved from the bottom of her heart. She is the kind of old intellectual that Wang Miao often sees. . Wang Miao took the vegetable basket and went upstairs with her. When he walked into her house, he found that the place was not as deserted as he had imagined—three children were playing, the oldest was no more than five years old, and the youngest was just walking. Yang's mother told Wang Miao that these were neighbor's children. "They like to play with me. Today is Sunday, and their parents have to work overtime, so they left them to me... Oh, Nan Nan, have you finished your painting? Well, it's so beautiful, let's start a topic Little duck under the sun, okay, grandma will write it for you, and then write June 9th, Nan Nan... What do you all want to eat at noon? Yangyang? Roasted eggplant? Good; Nannan? What you ate yesterday Snow peas? Okay; how about you, Mimi? Meat? No, your mother said, don’t eat so much meat, it’s not easy to digest, how about fish? Look at the big fish that grandma bought..." She definitely wanted a grandson or granddaughter, but even if Yang Dong lived, would she have children? Watching the conversation between Yang's mother and the children, Wang Miao thought. Mother Yang carried the basket into the kitchen, and when she came out, she said to Wang Miao: "Xiao Wang, I'll soak the vegetables first. There are a lot of pesticide residues in the vegetables now, and they need to be soaked for at least two hours for the children...you can first Go to Dongdong's room and have a look." Yang's last seemingly unintentional suggestion made Wang Miao nervous and uneasy, and she clearly saw the real purpose of Wang Miao's trip deep in her heart. After she finished speaking, she turned and went back to the kitchen without looking at Wang Miao, so naturally she couldn't see his embarrassment. Her almost seamless understanding moved Wang Miao for a while. Wang Miao turned around and walked through the happy children to the room that Yang's mother pointed to just now. He stopped in front of the door, suddenly overwhelmed by a strange feeling, as if returning to the time when he was young and dreamy, some crystal clear and fragile feelings like morning dewdrops emerged from the depths of his memory, which contained the original Sad and stinging, but all rosy. Wang Miao gently pushed the door open, and the faint breath that came to him was something he didn't expect, it was the breath of the forest, as if he had entered a forest ranger's hut. The walls are covered with strips of brown bark, the three stools are quaint tree stumps, the writing desk is also made of three larger tree stumps, and the bed is obviously covered with Northeast Ulagrass. It's all rough and casual, without trying to be aesthetically pleasing. With Yang Dong's position, her income is very high, and she can buy a house in any high-end community, but she has always lived here with her mother. Wang Miao walked to the tree stump writing desk. The furnishings on it were very simple, with nothing related to academics or women; maybe they have been taken away, or maybe they never existed here. He first noticed a black and white photo inlaid in a wooden mirror frame, which was a group photo of Yang Dong's mother and daughter. In the photo, Yang Dong was in his infancy, and his mother squatted down at exactly the same height as her. The wind was so strong that it blew their hair together. The background of the photo is very strange, the sky is grid-like, Wang Miao carefully inspected the thick steel structure supporting the network, and deduced that it was a parabolic antenna or something similar, because its edge was beyond the lens due to its huge size. In the photo, Xiao Yangdong's big eyes reveal a kind of fear that makes Wang Miao's heart tremble, as if the world outside the photo frightens her. The second thing Wang Miao noticed was a thick and large book placed in the corner of the desk. What confused him first was the material of the book. He saw a line of childish words on the cover: "Yang Dong's huà ( Birch bark." Only then did I realize that the book was made of birch bark, and time had turned the silver-white birch bark into a dull yellow. He reached out to touch the notebook, hesitated for a moment and retracted. "Look, it's Dongdong's childhood painting." Mother Yang said at the door. Wang Miao picked up the birch bark book and gently flipped through the pages. Each painting was dated, apparently by the mother for her daughter, as he had seen it when he first walked in. Wang Miao discovered another thing that was somewhat incomprehensible to him: Judging from the date on the painting, Yang Dong was already over three years old at this time, and children of this age can usually draw relatively distinct shapes of people or objects But Yang Dong's paintings are still just random and chaotic lines. Wang Miao can see a kind of strong anger and despair in them, a kind of anger and despair that wants to express something but can't do anything. What ordinary kids don't have. Mother Yang slowly sat down on the edge of the bed, staring absently at the birch bark book in Wang Miao's hand. It was here that her daughter ended her life in a peaceful sleep. Wang Miao sat down beside Yang's mother. He had never had such a strong desire to share the pain with others. Mother Yang took the birch bark book from Wang Miao's hand, hugged it to her chest, and said softly, "I don't know the depth of Dongdong's education, and I let her get in touch with things that are too abstract and too ultimate. When she first The first time I showed interest in those abstract theories, I told her that it was difficult for women to enter that world. Didn’t she say that Madame Curie entered? I told her that Madame Curie did not enter at all, her success was only It stems from hard work and persistence. Without her, others would have completed those tasks. Women like Wu Jianxiong[3] have gone further than her, but it is really not a woman’s world. Women’s way of thinking is different from men’s , There is no distinction between high and low, it is indispensable to the world." "Dongdong didn't refute me. Later, I really found out that she has some special things, such as telling her a formula, don't Her child would say things like 'this formula is so clever', and she would say it was beautiful and beautiful, and she would look like she saw a beautiful wild flower. Her father left a bunch of records, and she After listening to it, I finally chose a piece of Bach to listen to repeatedly. It is the music that is least likely to fascinate children, especially girls. At first I thought she did it randomly, but when I asked her how she felt, the child said : She saw a giant building a big and complicated house on the ground, the giant built it bit by bit, and the big house was finished after the music was over..." "Your education for your daughter is really successful." Wang Miao Said with emotion. "No, it's a failure! Her world is too simple, and there are only those ethereal theories. Once those things collapse, there is nothing to support her to live." "Ms. Ye, I don't think it's right for you to think so, now that it happened Something unimaginable to us, this is an unprecedented theoretical disaster, and she is not the only scientist who made this choice." "But she is the only woman, women should be like water, any place can be It can flow through." When he was leaving, Wang Miao thought of another purpose of his visit, so he told Yang's mother about observing the cosmic background radiation. "Oh, this, there are two places in China that are doing it. One is at the Urumqi Observation Base, which seems to be a project of the Space Environment Observation Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Made by the Astrophysics Center. The previous one is for actual ground observation, and the one in Beijing only receives satellite data, but the data is more accurate and comprehensive. There is one of my students there, let me help you get in touch.” Mother Yang said, looking for phone number, and calling that student, seemed to go well. "No problem, I'll give you an address, you can go directly. His name is Sha Ruishan, and he happens to be on the night shift tomorrow... You don't seem to be in this profession, do you?" Mother Yang put down the phone and asked. "I engage in nano, I do it for...some other things." Wang Miao was afraid that Mother Yang would press her further, but she didn't. "Xiao Wang, why do you look so bad? You seem to be weak." Mother Yang asked with concern. "It's nothing, that's it." Wang Miao said vaguely. "Wait a minute," Yang's mother took out a small wooden box from the cabinet, and Wang Miao saw that it was marked as ginseng, "An old soldier who was at the base came to see me two days ago and brought this... no, no , you take it, it’s artificially planted, it’s not a precious thing, I have high blood pressure, and I don’t need it at all. You can cut it into thin slices and make tea. I can see your face, as if the blood is bleeding. Young man, you must Take care of yourself." A warm current surged in Wang Miao's heart, his eyes became moist, and his heart, which had been tense for two days, seemed to be placed on soft velvet. "Ms. Ye, I will visit you often." He took the wooden box and said.''')

            '''Wang Miao drove along Jingmi Road to Miyun County, then turned to Heilongtan, walked a section of winding mountain road, and arrived at the radio astronomy observation base of the National Astronomical Observation Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He saw twenty-eight parabolic antennas with a diameter of nine meters lined up in the twilight, like a row of spectacular steel plants. Two tall 50-meter-diameter radio telescope antennas built in 2006 stood in this row At the end of the rice antenna, when the car approached, they reminded Wang Miao of the background of the photo of Yang Dong's mother and daughter. However, the projects undertaken by Ye Wenjie’s students have nothing to do with these radio telescopes. Dr. Sha Ruishan’s laboratory mainly receives the observation data of three satellites: the microwave background detection satellite COBE launched in November 1989, which is about to be eliminated, and launched in 2001 The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe satellite WMAP and the Planck high-precision cosmic microwave background probe Planck launched by the European Space Agency in 2009. The microwave background radiation spectrum of the universe as a whole is very precisely in line with the blackbody radiation spectrum with a temperature of 2.726K, which is highly isotropic, but there are fluctuations of about 5 parts per million in different parts. Sha Ruishan's job is to redraw a more accurate map of the microwave radiation background of the entire universe based on satellite observation data. This laboratory is not big, and the main computer room is full of satellite data receiving equipment, and there are three terminals that display data from three satellites respectively. When Sha Ruishan saw Wang Miao, he immediately showed the enthusiasm of a person who has worked in a lonely place for a long time when he sees a visitor, and asked him what observation data he would like to know. "I want to observe the overall fluctuation of the cosmic background radiation." "Can you... be more specific?" Sha Ruishan looked at Wang Miao with strange eyes. "That is, the overall isotropic fluctuation of the cosmic 3K microwave background radiation has an amplitude between 1% and 5%." Sha Ruishan smiled. As early as the beginning of this century, the Miyun Radio Astronomy Base Visitors are open to visit, and in order to earn some extra money, Sha Ruishan often acts as a tour guide or gives lectures. This kind of smile is what he often shows when answering questions from tourists (he has adapted to those appalling scientific illiteracy). "Mr. Wang, you...are not engaged in this major?" 1 "I am engaged in nanomaterials." "Oh, that's right. However, you probably know something about the cosmic 3K background radiation?" "Yes." Not much. The current theory of the origin of the universe holds that the universe was born in a big bang about 14 billion years ago. In the early days of the universe, the temperature was extremely high, and then it began to cool, forming a 'microwave background radiation' Embers'. This kind of residual background radiation that pervades the entire universe can be observed in the centimeter band. It seems that in 1960s, two Americans accidentally discovered The cosmic background radiation..." "Enough," Sha Ruishan interrupted Wang Miao's words with a wave of his hand, "then you should know that, unlike the small inhomogeneities in different parts we observe, the overall radiation background fluctuations of the universe are The expansion of the universe changes slowly on the time scale of the universe. With the precision of the Planck satellite, it may not be possible to measure this change until a million years later, but you want to find its 5% fluctuation tonight?! Know Does this mean anything? It means that the whole universe is flickering like a broken fluorescent tube!" And it was flickering for me, Wang Miao thought to himself. "Ms. Ye, are you kidding me?" Sha Ruishan shook his head and said. "I hope it's really a joke." Wang Miao said. He wanted to tell him that Ye Wenjie didn't know the details, but he was afraid that it would cause him to reject him, but this was what he meant. "Since Mr. Ye told you, let's observe it. It's not too much trouble anyway. You can use an old COBE with an accuracy of one percent." Sha Ruishan said, busy on the terminal, and soon a flat message appeared on the screen. Straight green line, "Look, this is the current real-time numerical curve of the overall background radiation of the universe. Dropped. If there is a fluctuation of more than one percent of the amplitude you said, the line will turn red and the fluctuation will be displayed. I bet it will also be a green line until the end of the world. To see it manifest with the naked eye It may take longer to get the changes than watching the sun destroy.” “Will it affect your normal work?” “Of course not, with such a rough precision, it is enough to use COBE to observe the leftovers of the data. Well, from now on, if that great fluctuation occurs, the value will be automatically saved." "Maybe until one o'clock in the morning." "Wow, so accurate? It doesn't matter, I'm on the night shift anyway. Have you eaten yet? That's good , let me show you around." It was a moonless night, and they strolled along the long antenna array. Sha Ruishan pointed to the antenna and said: "Isn't it spectacular? It's a pity that they are all deaf ears." "Why?" "Since they were built, there has been constant interference in the observation frequency band, first the paging stations in the late 1980s, and now It is the crazy development of mobile communications. Most of the projects that these meter-wave synthetic aperture radio telescopes can do, such as meter-wave surveys, radio variable sources, supernova relic research, etc., cannot be carried out normally. National Radio Regulatory Commission), useless, we can play China Mobile, Unicom, Netcom? No money, the mysteries of the universe count! Fortunately, my project relies on satellite data and has nothing to do with these 'tourist landscapes'." " In recent years, the commercial operation of many basic researches has been very successful, such as high-energy physics. Wouldn’t it be better to build the observation base farther away from the city?” “That’s still a question of money. Block out distractions on the Internet. Well, it would be nice if Teacher Ye was here, she is very knowledgeable in this area.” Then, they came to an all-night bar for tourists. Sha Ruishan became more talkative as he downed glass after glass of beer. The topic focused on Ye Wenjie. From her students, Wang Miao learned about her troubled first half of her life.''')

            '''China, 1967. The "Red United" attack on the headquarters building of the "April 28th Corps" has lasted for two days, and their flags are fluttering restlessly around the building, as if eager for dry wood. The commander of the "Red United" is very anxious. He is not afraid of the guards of the building. The more than 200 "April 28" fighters are the same as the "Red United", which was born in early 1966 and has experienced a large review and a large series. Much younger than that. What he was afraid of were the dozens of large iron furnaces in the building, which were filled with high explosives and connected in series with electric detonators. He couldn't see them, but he could feel their magnetism. Those little red guards on April 28 had this kind of spiritual power. Compared with the first generation of Red Guards who had matured a lot in the wind and rain, the new rebels were like wolves on burning coals, crazy or crazy. 1 A petite figure appeared on the top of the building. That beautiful girl was waving a large "April 28" flag. Her appearance immediately evoked a burst of chaotic gunfire. The shooting weapons were various, including old American carbines, Czech machine guns, and 38 caps, as well as brand new standard rifles and submachine guns—the latter was stolen from the army after the "August Editorial" was published—along with cold weapons such as pikes and broadswords, It constitutes a condensed history of modern times... The "April 28" people played this game many times in front of them. People who stood up on the top of the building, in addition to waving flags, sometimes shouted slogans or Throw leaflets down, and every time they can get out of the bullets unscathed and earn high honors for themselves. The girl who came out this time obviously believed that she still had that kind of luck. She is waving the battle flag, waving her burning youth, the enemy will be reduced to ashes in this flame, and the ideal world will be born in her boiling blood tomorrow... She is intoxicated in this bright red dream, until she is captured A rifle bullet pierced through the chest. The fifteen-year-old girl's chest was so tender. The bullet basically didn't slow down after passing through, and a chirp sounded in the air behind her. The young Red Guard fell from the roof of the building together with her flag, and her light body fell even slower than the flag, like a bird attached to the sky. In fact, compared to other people, she was lucky, at least she died in the magnificent passion of dedicating herself to her ideal. Such hotspots are all over the city, like countless parallel computing CPUs, linking the "Cultural Revolution" into a whole. Madness is like an invisible flood, submerging the city and seeping into every tiny nook and cranny. On the playground of the famous university on the edge of the city, a protest meeting attended by thousands of people has been going on for nearly two hours. In this age of factions, everywhere there are intricate opposing factions fighting. On campus, the Red Guards, the Cultural Revolution Working Group, the Worker Propaganda Team, and the Military Propaganda Team all broke out sharp conflicts with each other, and each faction split into new opposing factions from time to time, defending their respective backgrounds. And the program, a more brutal contest broke out. However, the reactionary academic authority being denounced this time is the target of the struggle that no one disagrees with, and they can only bear cruel blows from all sides at the same time. Compared with other ghosts and ghosts, reactionary academic authorities have their own characteristics: when the attack first comes, they are often arrogant and stubborn, and this is also the stage when their casualty rate is the highest; some of them were beaten to death for not pleading guilty , and some chose to use suicide to maintain their dignity. Those who survive this stage are numbed by the constant brutality of blows, a kind of self-protective spiritual shell that keeps them from a final breakdown. They often fall into a semi-sleep state at the criticism meeting, and only a threat can wake them up, mechanically repeating the confession that has been said countless times; then, some of them enter the third stage, the protracted criticism. Infused with quicksilver political images into their consciousness, and shattered their edifices of knowledge and reason, they truly believed themselves guilty, and truly saw the damage they had done to a great cause, and wept over it Runny nose, their confession is often much deeper and more sincere than those non-intellectual ghosts and ghosts. For the Red Guards, the objects of criticism in the last two stages are the most boring. Only the ghosts and monsters in the first stage can effectively stimulate their already overexcited nerves, just like the red cloth on the matador's hand, But there are fewer and fewer such objects, and there may be only one left in this university, and he was reserved for the final appearance of the criticism meeting because of his rarity. Ye Zhetai has lived from the Cultural Revolution to the present, and has been in the first stage. He has not pleaded guilty, committed suicide, and is not numb. When the physics professor stepped onto the stage of criticism, his expression clearly said: Let the cross I bear be heavier! The burden the Red Guards placed on him was indeed heavy, but it was not a cross. The tall hats worn by other targets of criticism are all framed with bamboo strips, but the one he wears is welded with a finger-thick steel bar, and the plaque he hangs on his chest is not hung by someone else. Instead of a wooden panel, an iron door from one of the laboratory ovens had his name boldly written in black, with a large red cross drawn diagonally. The number of Red Guards who escorted Ye Zhetai to power was double that of other targets of criticism. There were six of them, two men and four women. The two young men walked steadily and vigorously, and they looked like mature young Bolsheviks. They were all seniors majoring in theoretical physics in the Department of Physics, and Ye Zhetai was their teacher; These little soldiers in military uniforms and armed belts surrounded Ye Zhetai like four green flames with compelling youthful vigor. The appearance of Ye Zhetai excited the crowd below, and the slogans that had been a little weak just now rose up again like a new wave, drowning everything. After patiently waiting for the slogans to subside, one of the two male Red Guards on the stage turned to the object of criticism: "Ye Zhetai, you are proficient in various mechanics, you should see how powerful the great force you are resisting is, and be stubborn." It’s a dead end! Continue the agenda of the last conference today, so I won’t talk nonsense. Answer the following question honestly: Did you add a lot of relativity content in the basic courses of the 1962 to 1965 sessions without authorization?!” “ The theory of relativity has become a classical theory of physics, how can it not be covered in basic courses?" Ye Zhetai replied. "You're talking nonsense!" A female Red Guard next to her snapped. "Einstein is a reactionary academic authority. He has a milk and a mother. He went to build atomic bombs for American imperialism! To establish revolutionary science, we must Down with the black flag of bourgeois theory represented by the theory of relativity!" Ye Zhetai was silent, he was enduring the pain caused by the iron hat on his head and the iron plate on his chest, and he kept silent on questions that were not worth answering. Behind him, his student also frowned slightly. The girl who spoke was the most talented among the four middle school Red Guards, and she was obviously prepared. I saw her reciting the critique manuscript just before she came on stage, but to deal with Ye Zhetai, she only needed a few slogans It is not acceptable. They decided to show off the new weapons prepared for the teacher today, and one of them waved to the audience. Ye Zhetai's wife, Shao Lin, a professor of physics in the same department, stood up from the front row and walked onto the stage. She was wearing a very ill-fitting grass-green dress, obviously trying to get closer to the colors of the Red Guards, but people who knew Shao Lin always thought of her who used to wear delicate cheongsam to give lectures, and they always felt awkward. "Ye Zhetai!" Shao Lin pointed at her husband and shouted, she was obviously not used to this kind of occasion, she tried her best to raise her voice, but even the trembling in it was amplified, "You didn't expect that I would stand up to expose you and criticize you! Yes, I was deceived by you before, you blinded me with your reactionary world outlook and scientific outlook! Now I wake up, with the help of the young revolutionary generals, I want to stand on the side of the revolution, the side of the people!" She Turning to the audience, "Comrades, young revolutionaries, and revolutionary faculty and staff, we should recognize the reactionary nature of Einstein's theory of relativity. This nature is most clearly reflected in general relativity: the static universe model it proposes negates The nature of matter in motion is anti-dialectics! It believes that the universe is limited, and it is a complete reactionary idealism..." Hearing his wife's eloquent speech, Ye Zhetai smiled wryly. Lin, did I deceive you? In fact, you have always been a mystery in my heart. Once, I praised your extraordinary talent to your father-he was lucky to go early and escaped the disaster-the old man shook his head and said that my daughter could not make any achievements in academics; then, he I uttered a sentence that was very important for the rest of my life: Linlin is too smart, but she must be stupid to engage in basic theories. Over the years that followed, I continued to realize the profound meaning of these words. Lynn, you are really smart. As early as a few years ago, you sniffed out the political wind in the intellectual world and made some advanced moves. For example, you changed most of the laws and parameters of physics in your teaching. name, Ohm’s law was changed to the law of resistance, Maxwell’s equations were renamed to electromagnetic equations, Planck’s constant was called a quantum constant... You explained to the students: All scientific achievements are the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people. Academic authority simply steals this wisdom. But even so, you are still not accepted by the "revolutionary mainstream". Look at you now, you don't have the red armbands on your sleeves that "revolutionary faculty and staff" wear; you come up empty-handed, and you are not even eligible for a quotation ... Who made you born in such a prominent family in old China, and your parents are such famous scholars. When it comes to Einstein, you have more to say than I do. In the winter of 1922, when Einstein visited Shanghai, your father was arranged to be one of the escorts because of his good German. You told me many times that your father embarked on the path of physics under Einstein's personal teaching, and you chose physics major because of your father's influence, so Ai Weng can also be regarded as your indirect mentor, you I am extremely proud and happy for this. I later learned that your father told you a white lie, and that he had only one extremely short exchange with Einstein. It was the morning of November 13, 1922. He accompanied Einstein for a walk on Nanjing Road. He seemed to be accompanied by Yu Youren, the president of Shanghai University, Cao Gubing, the manager of "Ta Kung Pao", and others. A small stone-breaking worker stopped beside him, silently looked at this boy in tattered clothes in the cold wind, with dirty hands and face, and asked your father: How much does he earn a day? After asking Xiaogong, your father replied: five points. This is the only communication he has with the master of science who changed the world. There is no physics, no theory of relativity, only cold reality. According to your father, after hearing his answer, Einstein stood there silently for a while, watching Xiaogong's numb work, and did not take a puff even after the pipe in his hand was extinguished. After recalling this incident, your father sighed to me: In China, any thought that transcends the sky will crash to the ground, and the gravitational pull of reality is too heavy. "Lower your head!" a male Red Guard ordered loudly. This may be the sympathy left by his students for the teacher, and those who are criticized will bow their heads, but if Ye Zhetai wants to do this, the heavy iron hat will fall off. He put it on. But Ye Zhetai still held his head up, using his thin neck to support the heavy bundle of steel. "Bow your head! You reactionary diehard!!" A female Red Guard next to her took off her waist belt and swung it at Ye Zhetai. The brass buckle hit his forehead, leaving a precise shape of the buckle there. But it was soon blurred into a black and purple mass by congestion. He wobbled a bit, then regained his footing. A male Red Guard questioned Ye Zhetai: "In the teaching of quantum mechanics, you also spread a lot of reactionary remarks!" After speaking, he nodded to Shao Lin, motioning her to continue. Shaolin couldn't wait to continue, and she had to keep talking without pausing to keep her faltering spirit from completely breaking down. "Ye Zhetai, you can't deny this! You have spread the reactionary Copenhagen explanation to the students many times!" "After all, this is currently the most recognized explanation that fits the experimental results." The tone is still so calm, which makes Shao Lin very surprised and terrified. "This explanation holds that external observations lead to the collapse of the quantum wave function. This is another manifestation of reactionary idealism, and it is the most rampant manifestation!" "Is philosophy guiding experiments or experiments guiding philosophy?" Ye Zhetai asked, his sudden counterattack made the critics at a loss for a while. "Of course the correct Marxist philosophy guides scientific experiments!" said a male Red Guard. "This is tantamount to saying that correct philosophy falls from the sky. Opposing practice to produce true knowledge is exactly against the Marxist principle of cognition of the natural world." Shao Lin and two university red guards were speechless. It is different from the Red Guards on the road, they cannot be unreasonable. But the four young generals from the attached middle school have their own "invincible" revolutionary method. The girl who did it just now slammed Ye Zhetai's belt again, and the other three girls also picked up the belt and slapped Ye Zhetai. , they must appear more revolutionary, or at least equally revolutionary. The two male Red Guards did not intervene. If they were involved in this matter now, they would be suspected of being unrevolutionary. "You still spread the Big Bang theory in your teaching, which is the most reactionary of all scientific theories!" A male Red Guard tried to change the subject. "Maybe this theory will be overthrown in the future, but the two major cosmological discoveries of this century: the Hubble redshift and the 3K cosmic background radiation make the big bang theory the most credible theory of the origin of the universe so far." "Nonsense!" Shao Lin yelled, and went on to talk about the Big Bang, naturally not forgetting to deeply analyze its reactionary nature. But the super novelty of the theory attracted the brightest of the four little girls, who couldn't help but ask: "Even time began at that singularity!? What was there before that singularity?" "Nothing " Ye Zhetai said, like answering any little girl's question, he turned his head and looked at her kindly, the iron tall hat and the serious injury he had suffered made it very difficult for him to do this. "What... nothing?! Reactionary! Reactionary!!" The girl yelled in horror, she turned to Shaolin for help at a loss, and got an immediate response. "This leaves room for the existence of God." Shaolin nodded to the girl as a reminder. The little Red Guard's dazed train of thought immediately found a foothold, and she pointed at Ye Zhetai with her hand clenched on the belt, "Are you trying to say that there is a God?!" "I don't know." "What did you say!" "I mean I don’t know, if God refers to the superconsciousness outside the universe, I don’t know if it exists; both positive and negative, science has not given definite evidence.” In fact, at this nightmarish moment, Ye Zhetai has tended to to believe it doesn't exist anymore. This outrageous remark caused commotion in the entire venue, and another wave of slogans erupted under the leadership of a Red Guard on stage. "Down with Ye Zhetai, the reactionary academic authority!!" "Down with all the reactionary academic authorities!!" "Down with all the reactionary theories!!"... "God does not exist, and all religions are spiritual tools fabricated by the ruling class to paralyze the people !” the little girl said loudly after the slogan died down. "This view is one-sided." Ye Zhetai said calmly. The little red guard who became angry immediately made a judgment, all words were meaningless to this dangerous enemy in front of him. She swung her belt and rushed up, and her three little comrades followed immediately. Ye Zhetai was very tall, and these four fourteen-year-old girls could only hit his head that refused to bow by swinging the belt upwards. After the first few blows, the iron tall hat that had provided some protection was knocked off his head, and then the wide leather belt with copper buckles rained down on his head and body—he finally fell , This inspired the little red guards, they continue this "noble" battle more devotedly, they are fighting for their beliefs, fighting for their ideals, they are intoxicated by the glorious mission given to them by history, and they are proud of their bravery Proud... "The highest instruction: fight with words and not with martial arts!" Ye Zhetai's two students finally made up their minds and yelled these words. baby. But it was already too late. The physicist was lying quietly on the ground, watching the bloodstain flowing from his head with half-closed eyes. Slowly crawling like a red snake, when it reached the edge of the platform, it dripped drop by drop on an empty box below, making a rhythmic "click" sound, like footsteps fading away. A burst of strange laughter broke the silence. This sound was made by Shao Lin, whose spirit had completely collapsed, and it sounded terrifying. People started leaving and it turned into a rout where everyone wanted to get out of the place as quickly as possible. The venue quickly emptied, leaving only one girl standing under the stage. She is Ye Zhetai's daughter Ye Wenjie. When the four girls violently took their father's life, she wanted to rush to the stage, but the two old school workers beside her grabbed her tightly and told her not to take her own life in a low voice , the venue was already in complete madness at that time, and her appearance would only attract more thugs. She once cried hoarsely, but her voice was drowned in the crazy slogans and cheers at the venue. When everything fell silent, she couldn't make any sound herself, and just stared at her father's lifeless body on the stage. What was not cried and shouted pervades and dissolves in her blood, and will stay with her for the rest of her life. After the crowd dispersed, she stood there, her body and limbs still maintained the posture when the old school worker grabbed her, motionless, as if petrified. After a long time, she put down her dangling arm, slowly got up and walked onto the stage, sat beside her father's body, held one of his cold hands, and looked into the distance with absent-minded eyes. When the body was about to be carried away, Ye Wenjie took something out of her pocket and put it in her father's hand. It was her father's pipe. Wen Jie silently left the deserted playground and walked home. When she walked downstairs to the faculty dormitory, she heard bursts of silly laughter coming from her window on the second floor. This sound was made by the woman she once called mother. Wen Jie turned around silently and walked away, letting her feet lead her elsewhere. 2''')
